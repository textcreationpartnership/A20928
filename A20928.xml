            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And on the contrarie, I can but exhort and ſtirre thee vp to buy and reade this and other ſuch like treatiſes, that ſo thou maiſt be the better prepared, (though not to take vpon thee the cure of thine owne or others their ſicke estate) to diſcerne betwixt the ignorant and the learned, and the skilfull in word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thoſe which are skilfull in deede. As alſo that thou maiſt bee the better able to manifeſt and make knowne by word or writing the ſtate and true condition of thy diſeaſe, vnto the profound and long ſtudied in that profeſſion, who for the keeping of a good conſcience and thy welfare, haue not ſpared their bodies or goods, or refuſed any good meanes, whereby they might become fit to furniſh thee with wholeſome counſaile and due reliefe in the daies of thy distreſſe. Here ſhalt thou finde by ſerious ſuruay, great dimenſions within ſmall and narrow bounds. This volume ſhalt thou finde ſtuffed
<pb facs="tcp:11348:4"/>full of Phiſicke, as teaching by the leſſer, what is to bee conceiued of the greater: and by a few, what is to bee followed in many. Full of Philoſophie, as not resting in the things of the bodie, but deeply and diuinely laying open the nature of the ſoule. Herein is contained not onely great plentie of precepts, but alſo many controuerſies of great moment and difficultie, ſharply and pithily decided: and that with ſuch varietie of authoritie, as is not almost in any other to bee found. This treatiſe ſhalt thou finde full of pleaſantnes, as both the ſtore of histories, and meanes of diſpelling the mournfull fantaſies of melancholike moodes, doe giue thee to conceiue: full of delight as maintaining the ſight, the conductor and conueier of delights vnto the minde: full of healthfulnes, as teaching the way to auoide the rheume, that pregnant mother of ſo many maladies. And finally full of instruction and reliefe for the mitigating of the annoyances and inconueniences of drouping old age, as ſhewing the maner how to ſquare out and piteh downe the firme and durable props of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing and long inioying of ſtrong and lustie yeares. Which if thou ſtriue and ſeeke accordingly to attaine, then ſhalt thou be the better able to diſcharge the duties of thy calling whilest thou liueſt, and purchaſe to thy ſelfe a million of good witneſſes, to reioyce and glad thy hart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the day of thy death and diſſolution.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Adame, ſince the houre that I had the hap to become knowne vnto you, you haue done me the honour as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your health altogether into my hands, and to vouchſafe me as great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as if I had been a ſecond <hi>Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius.</hi> This affection and goodwill, which I acknowledge to proceede more of your kindnes and naturall inclination, then of any deſerts of mine, haue ſo preuailed with me, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the loue of my country, nor the number of my friends, which was not ſmall, nor the honourable place of publique Lecturer, which I diſcharged with ſufficient commendation in one of the moſt famous Vniuerſities of Europe, could ſtay or hinder me; but that paſſing ouer all difficulties, and breaking all theſe bonds, I haue intirely and wholly deuoted my ſelfe vnto you, and haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed you, whereſoeuer it hath pleaſed you to commaund me. I haue wherein I may exceedingly praiſe my ſelfe, and as hitherto to reſt contented with my fortune, which hath been ſo fauourable vnto me, as to make all my ſeruice profitable and well liked of, I am verely perſwaded Madame, that it was Gods will to vſe me as the meanes for the lengthening of your yeares, and making of your old age more bleſſed and happie. You haue had ſufficient triall thereof within theſe two yeares: for being very forcibly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed with three of the moſt violent and extraordinarie diſeaſes that euer man hath ſeene, and which were ſtrong enough to haue ſhaken the beſt complexion in the world, and to haue ſpilt the proſperous eſtate of a more flouriſhing age then yours, yet you haue not felt any eclipſe of your vigour and luſtines. This is of
<pb facs="tcp:11348:5"/>God alone, (which hath opened my vnderſtanding to finde out fit remedies, and himſelfe to giue good ſucceſſe thereunto) to whom I am bound to render all glorie. There now remaineth in you onely your three ordinarie diſeaſes, which I labour to vanquiſh day by day, by obſeruation of good Diet, and ſuch gentle medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as are no way able any thing to alter and hurt the good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of your naturall conſtitution. In your right eye, you haue ſome ſmall beginnings of a Cataract, but the other is perfectly ſound. You feele at certaine times ſome touches of the windie melancholie, but ſo ſleight, as that they vaniſh away like the ſmoke. The thing that is moſt tedious and troubleſome vnto you, is thoſe pettie diſtillations and fluxes of humours which fall down vpon your eyes, teeth, armes and legges. Your ſpirit, which is able to conceiue of any thing in the world, be it neuer ſo rare &amp; ſtrange, hath been very inquiſitiue to vnderſtand the cauſes, and to know from whence all theſe accidents ſhould proceede, which I haue oftentimes ſpoken largely of, and that both in vulgar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeeches, as alſo in the artificiall and plaine tearmes of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke. In the end my reaſons became ſo well liked of by you, that (when you had withdrawne your ſelfe to the Abbey of <hi>Marmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> to ſport your ſelfe with the beautie of the place and goodnes of the ayre) you commaunded me to ſet downe the ſame in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and to cauſe them to come to light, vnder the ſhield of your authoritie. I cannot with honeſtie denie it vnto you, howſoeuer yet it were meete, that ſo waightie a matter according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, ſhould bee garniſhed with infinite varietie of authorities and proofes from the learned, which my memorie could not affoord, through my want of bookes. I haue therefore fitted vp and made readie three diſcourſes for you, touching your three diſeaſes: the firſt is, <hi>Of the excellencie of the ſight, and the meanes to preſerue it:</hi> the ſecond is, <hi>Of windie melancholie, and other melancholike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes:</hi> the third is, <hi>Of Rheumes, and the meanes for to heale them.</hi> And vnto theſe in the ende I haue ioyned a little treatiſe of Olde age, which may bee for your vſe againſt the time to come. For there is no ſhadow of reaſon why I ſhould as yet call you old, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are not incombred with any of the infirmities of old age.

<pb facs="tcp:11348:5"/>ſo wiſe and graue, to ſee your vnderſtanding and iudgement ſo ſound and vncorrupt, your memorie ſo freſh and plentifull, and your ſences ſo abſolute, as that on your ſound eye you vſe to reade a farre off the ſmalleſt letter that any man can bring vnto you, without ſpectacles? Your hearing alſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth very eaſie and quicke, and your taſte alſo as exquiſite and daintie as euer it was: your heart ſo couragious and luſtie, as that notwithſtanding all the aſſaults that euer your windie melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie could giue vnto it, yet it hath not been able at any time ſo to ſhake it, as that it could make it alter his courſe: your liuer ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, as that it miniſtreth ſtore of blood more then is needfull: in ſo much as that we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to cauſe you to tame it once a yeare. I will ſay nothing of the goodnes of your ſtomack, you your ſelfe know it well enough; hauing an appetite at euery houre, and diſgeſting whatſoeuer you beſtow vpon it. Seeing then the faculties of the ſoule doe euery one of them ſo well execute and performe their functions and offices, can a man call the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof ouerworne or old? I am perſwaded (Madame) that no man can call you old in any reſpect, if it were not that you are paſt fiftie, and that cuſtome in accounts hath deſigned the firſt degree of old age to this number. You haue great occaſions to praiſe God: for this long and happie life is a certaine teſtimonie of his loue, becauſe the moſt excellent reward which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto them whom he loueth in this world, is, that they ſhall liue long vpon the earth. Cheere vp your ſelfe then Madame, you are but yet on the firſt ſtep of your old age, which is ouergrowne with flouriſhing greene, and affoording an vndaunted courage; you haue other two behinde and remaining. God who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen this ſtrength vnto your bodie, and which hath honoured you with ſo gracious and good a ſoule, vouchſafe to make them as happie, as your Ladiſhip can wiſh or deſire them.</p>

And euen in like ſort,<note place="margin">The heauens and the heart finely compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together.</note> as the heauens are the principals, whereon depend and reſt all other elemental generations and alterations: ſo the hart is the firſt and principall originall of all the actions and motions of the bodie. The heauens bring forth their, wonderfull effects, by their motions, heate and influence: the heart by his continuall mouing (which ought no leſſe to rauiſh vs, then the flowing and ebbing of Euripus) and influence of his ſpirits, doth put life into all the other parts, endoweth them with this beautiful and vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionlike colour, and maintaineth their naturall heate. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and light which are in the ſuperiour bodies, are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the intelligences and of the heauens: of the intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as being the firſt cauſe of mouing in others, being themſelues immoueable: of the heauens, as firſt mouing the other, and being themſelues moued. The mouing of the heart and vitall ſpirit, which diſtributeth it ſelfe like vnto light, throughout, and that as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11348:10"/>it were in the twinkling of an eye, are the inſtruments of the mind and heart: of the minde, which is a chiefe and principall mouer, and yet not moued: of the heart, as of a chiefe and principall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which is moued of the minde. It is therefore the heart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of the Peripatetikes, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true manſion of the ſoule, the onely prince and gouernour, in this ſo excellent and admirable diſpoſing of all things in the gouernment of the bodie. <hi>Chryſippus</hi> and all the Stoikes haue followed the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and doe beleeue that all that region which containeth the parts which wee call vitall, is named of the Grecians and Latines <hi>Thorax,</hi> becauſe it keepeth within it, as it were vnder lock, this heauenly vnderſtanding (ſo called of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi>): this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning heate, (ſo called of <hi>Zeno</hi>) repleniſhed with a million of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: this admirable fire, which <hi>Prometheus</hi> ſtole out of heauen to put ſoule and life into mankinde: this altering ſpirit, whereof <hi>Theocritus</hi> made ſo great account. Behold how theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers haue diuerſly ſpoken of the ſeate of the ſoule. It is not my minde to beſtow any time in the particuler examination of all theſe opinions, either is it mine intent in this place to enter into any diſpute, intending to content my ſelfe with the ſimple deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of the trueth.<note place="margin">That the brain is the principall ſeate of the ſoule.</note> For I aſſure my ſelfe that it ſhall be ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ouerthrow all theſe falſe foundations. I ſay then that the principall ſeate of the ſoule is in the braine, becauſe the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt powers thereof doe lodge and lye there, and the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie actions of the ſame doe there moſt plainly appeare. All the inſtruments of motion, ſence, imagination, diſcourſe and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie are found within the braine, or immediatly depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon. Anatomie manifeſteth vnto our eyes,<note place="margin">The reaſons to proue the ſame. The firſt.</note> how that there iſſue out from the lower part of the braine ſeuen great paire of ſinewes, which ſerue at a trice to conuey the animall ſpirit vnto the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſences, and doe not any of them paſſe out of the head except the ſixt paire, which ſtretch out themſelues to the mouth of the ſtomacke. We ſee alſo that from the hindermoſt part of the braine (where the great and little braine doe meete together) doth proceede the admirable taile, the beautifull and white ſpinall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which the Wiſeman in his booke of the Preacher calleth the ſiluer threed, how it is carefully preſerued within a ſacred chanell,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11348:11"/>as <hi>Lactantius</hi> calleth it. From the ſame, men ſee that there riſe a million of little ſinewes, which conuey the powers of mouing and feeling, vnto all ſuch members as are capable of the ſame. Men doe alſo perceiue the outward ſences placed round about the braine,<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> which are as the light horſemen and meſſengers of the vnderſtanding, the principall part of the ſoule. <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith, that when men come within the view of a princes guard, they thinke himſelfe not to bee farre off: we ſee all the guard and ſeruants of reaſon, as the eyes, the eares, the noſe, the tongue, to bee ſituated in the head: whereupon by conſequent we ought to iudge that this princeſſe is not farre off. Experience alſo giueth vs to vnderſtand, that if the braine haue his temperature altered:<note place="margin">The third.</note> as for example, if it be too hot, as it falleth out in ſuch as are franticke: or ouer cold, as it falleth out in melancholick men; it corrupteth preſently the imaginatiue facultie, troubleth the iudgement, weakeneth the memorie: which is not incident in the diſeaſes of the heart, as namely, either in a hectick feuer, or when a man is poyſoned. The ſoule (ſaith that diuine Philoſopher <hi>Plato</hi>) doth not pleaſe and content it ſelfe with that braine which is too ſoft,<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> too cloſe and compact, or too hard: it requireth a good temperature. If the proportion of the head be but a little out of ſquare, ſo that it be either too great or too little, or too coppeld, as that which men reade of <hi>Therſites</hi> in <hi>Homer:</hi> or altogether round and not flat on the ſides, as naturally it ought to be: men may perceiue all the actions of the ſoule to be depraued, and thereupon doe call ſuch heads, fooliſh, without iudgement, without wiſedome: all which ought to make vs as well to beleeue that the braine is as much the organe and inſtrument of all theſe actions: as the eye is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſight.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this kind of round ſhape which is peculiar vnto mankinde,<note place="margin">The fift.</note> this head thus lifted vp to heauen, this great quantitie of braine (which is almoſt incredible) doth ſhew very well that man hath ſomething in his head, more then other liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The wiſe Sages of Egypt haue very well acknowledged the ſame: for they did not ſweare by any other thing but by their head, they ratified all their couenants by the head, and forbad the eating of the braines of liuing creatures: for the honour and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11348:11"/>ſake which they bare to this part. I thinke alſo that the falling ſicknes was not for any other reaſon called ſacred of the ancients, but becauſe it did aſſaile the ſoueraigne and ſacred part of the body. Let vs then acknowledge the braine to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſeate of the ſoule, the originall of mouing and feeling, and of all the other moſt noble functions of the ſame. I know well that ſome curious ſpirits will aske me, how it can bee the author of ſo many goodly actions, ſeeing it is cold, and that the ſoule can doe nothing without heate. But I anſwere,<note place="margin">The cauſe why the braine fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not.</note> that the braine hath not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particuler feeling, for that it being the ſeate of common ſence, muſt iudge of all ſuch obiects, as about which ſence is occupied. But a good iudge ought to bee free from all paſsions, and euery organe (ſayth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) muſt bee without qualitie, according whereunto agreeth that, that the chriſtalline humour hath no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the care hath no particuler ſound, nor the tongue any taſte. But and if it come to paſſe, that any organicall part decline from his nature, as if the chriſtalline become yellow, all whatſoeuer preſenteth it ſelfe to the ſight of that eye, will ſeeme to bee of the ſame colour. As then the braine neither ſeeth nor heareth, nor ſmelleth nor taſteth any thing, and yet notwithſtanding iudgeth very rightly of colours, ſounds, ſmels and taſts: ſo neither was it any reaſon, that it ſhould haue any particuler ſence of feeling, which ſhould cauſe it to feele the exceſſe of thoſe qualities, which are tearmed the obiects of feeling and handling; it is ſufficient for it to haue the knowledge and diſcerning thereof. As touching the other poynt, I affirme that the braine is in very deede hot, and that it cannot be called cold, but as it is compared with the heart. It behoued it of neceſſitie to bee of this temperature, that ſo it might temper the ſpirits which were of a fierie nature,<note place="margin">The cauſes why the braine is of ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.</note> thereby the better to continue the kindes of liuing creatures, and to preſerue them long aliue. For and if the braine were as hot as the heart, there would day by day ariſe trouble and ſedition amidſt the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt powers of the ſoule: all the ſences would be ſtraying and wandring, all the motions would bee out of ſquare, all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes mixed with raſh headines, and our memories very flote and fugitiue, euen as betideth vnto franticke ones. Let nothing then hinder vs from acknowledging the braine to bee the moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11348:12"/>noble part of the whole body. This is that magnificent and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turret of the ſoule, this is that goodly royall palace, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated houſe of <hi>Pallas,</hi> this is the impregnable ſort, enuironed with bones, as with ſtrong walles, wherein is lodged the ſoueraigne power of the ſoule, (I meane reaſon) which comprehendeth and compaſſeth as with imbracing armes, the whole vniuerſall world in a moment, without touching of the ſame, which flieth through the ayre, ſoundeth the depths of the ſea, and ſurmounteth at the ſame inſtant, the pauements of the heauens, and which walking vpon their ſtages, meaſuring their diſtances, and communicating with the Angels, pearceth in euen vnto the throne of God, and at ſuch time as the body is aſleepe, ſuffereth it ſelf by a holy flight, or delectable and ſweete rauiſhment, to be carried euen to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of God, according to whoſe image it was firſt framed. To be ſhort, it is all in all (as ſayth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) for that by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer it hath, it poſſeſſeth all, as being the place wherein (I ſay) this great princeſſe would reſt her ſelf as within her caſtle, from thence to commaund the two inferiour regiments, to hold in ſubiection the two lower forces, (I meane the Iraſcible and concupiſcible) which would euery day be ready to fall away and reuolt. And yet I dare be bold to adde further, and (in ſtead of hauing named it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the chiefe and principall) to ſay that there is not any other part of the body beſides the braine, which can truly be called noble and ſoueraigne, and that becauſe all the other parts are made for the braine, and pay tribute thereunto as to their king. Behold here the ſtrength of my argument,<note place="margin">Moſt cleere and euident proofe of the excellencie of the braine.</note> which in my iudgement is as cleere as the Sunne in his brighteſt ſhine. Mankinde differeth not from beaſts in any thing but reaſon: and the ſeate of reaſon is in the braine: It is requiſite the more commendably to reaſon and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that the imaginatiue part of the minde ſhould ſet before the vnderſtanding part of the ſame the obiects whereabout they be occupied altogether ſimple without mixture, without matter, and freed from all corporall qualities. The Imaginatiue part can not conceiue them of it ſelfe, if the outward ſences (which are his truſtie ſpyes and faithfull reportſmen) make not certificate of the ſame. Hence then riſe the neceſſitie of framing the inſtruments of the ſences, the eyes, the eares, the noſe, tongue and membranes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11348:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>as well inward as outward. The ſences the better to take acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their obiects, haue need of a local motion. For man, if he ſhould not ſtirre from one place, but abide immoueable like an image, ſhould not be able to conuey any ſtore of varietie vnto the imagination. It is neceſſary then for the benefit and perfecting of the ſences, to haue certaine inſtruments of motion: theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments are two, the ſinewes and the muſcles: the ſinewes by reaſon of their continued coniunction and adherence vnto their originall, (being like vnto that of the Sunne beames with the Sun) doe conuey from the braine that mouing power, ſeated in a moſt ſubtile bodie, namely, the animall ſpirit: the muſcles after the maner of good ſubiects obey vnto their commandement, and incontinently moue the member either by ſtretching it forth or bowing it in, as the appetite or imagination ſhall wiſh and deſire. The braine then (as is manifeſt) commandeth: the ſinewes carrie the embaſſage, and the muſcles obeying thereunto, expreſſe the intent of the minde. And euen in like ſort as the skilfull horſerider manageth the horſe with the bridle, cauſing him to turne on the right hand or on the left, as beſt pleaſeth him: euen ſo the braine by the ſinewes boweth or ſtretcheth the muſcles. Theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of voluntarie motion; ſhould not know either how to be, or vndergoe theſe their offices, if they were not fixed vnto ſome ſolide and immoueable body. Therefore it was behouefull to raiſe vp pillers, ſuch as are the bones and cartilages, from whence the muſcles doe riſe, and into which they do inſert themſelues againe: and for that the bones could not bee ioyned or faſtned together without ligaments, it muſt needes follow that they ſhould haue their membranouſe coates to couer them withall. And all theſe parts for their preſeruation, ſtoode in neede of naturall heate and nouriſhment: this heate and nouriſhment being deriued from elſewhere, muſt needes haue their paſſages prepared by certaine pipes, and thoſe are the veines and arteries: the arteries draw their ſpirits from the hart, the fountaine of the ſame: the veines receiue their blood from the common ſtorehouſe of the ſame which is the liuer. And thus returning by the ſame ſteps, by which wee came hither, wee ſhall well perceiue,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> that the heart and liuer were not made for any other thing, but to nouriſh the heate of all the parts:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11348:13"/>the bones and cartilages, for reſts and props vnto the muſcles and ſinewes, the inſtruments of voluntary motion: the muſcles and nerues for the perfecting of the ſences: the ſences, to ſet before the imaginatiue power of the minde their outward obiects: the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to carrie along the formes of things voide of ſubſtance, to be more deeply weighed of reaſon, which thereupon commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to the cuſtodie of memorie her treaſureſſe. Thus euery thing yeelding obedience vnto reaſon, and the braine being the principall ſeate of reaſon, we muſt needs affirme, that all the parts of the body were made for the braine, and muſt therfore acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it as their chiefe and Soueraigne.</p>
               <p>I will yet adde one other plaine and euident argument (which in my iudgement is not common) to teſtifie the excellence of this part: which is, that it giueth ſhape and perfection vnto all the reſt. For it is moſt certaine, that of the ſhape and quantitie of the braine, dependeth the groſnes, greatnes, ſmalnes: and in a word, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery maner of proportion hapning to the head, foraſmuch as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry containing thing doth conforme it ſelfe continually vnto the contained, as the thing for which it was created and made. Ioyntly after the head, followeth the backe bone, which is framed of foure and twentie vertebres, beſides the bone called <hi>Sacrum,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that which men call the truncke of the body. If that hole in the head through which the marrow of the backe falleth be great, then muſt alſo the vertebres bee large. Vpon this backe bone doe all the reſt of the bones ſtay and reſt themſelues, as the vpper tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers doe vpon the keele of a ſhip. As by name vpon high the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bones, (whereunto are faſtned the armes aſwell on the one ſide, as on the other) and the twelue ribs: and below the bones of the ſmall guts and hips, into whoſe hollow cauities the heads of the bones of the thighes are inſerted: ſo that if all their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be duly obſerued, it will appeare that the greatnes and groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof is anſwerable to that of the head, and by conſequence to that of the braine, as the chiefe and principall. Vnto the bones are faſtned the muſcles, the ligaments, and the moſt of the other parts of the body doe reſt themſelues thereupon, and within their circuite and compaſſe are ſhut and made ſure the moſt noble parts and the bowels. In few words: the bones impart vnto the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11348:13"/>whole bodie the ſhape which themſelues haue receiued from the braine. This is the ſame which diuine <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath very well obſerued in the ſecond booke of his Epidemiques, ſaying, that of the greatnes and groſnes of the head, a Phiſition might iudge of the greatnes of all the other bones and parts alſo, as veines, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſinewes. Let vs therefore conclude with the trueth, that the braine hauing ſuch aduantage againſt the other parts, ought to be eſteemed the chiefe and principall ſeate of the ſoule.</p>

Now the ſences which we call externall are onely fiue;<note place="margin">Why there are but fiue ſences.</note> the fight, the hearing, the ſmelling, the taſte and handling, of which altogether dependeth our knowledge, and nothing (as ſaith the Philoſopher) can enter into the vnderſtanding part of our minde, except it paſſe through one of theſe fiue doores. Some men ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to ſhew reaſon for this number,<note place="margin">The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> ſay that there are but fiue ſences, becauſe that whatſoeuer is in the whole world, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and made of onely fiue ſimple bodies, as the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the firmament, which they call the fift ſimple nature, being much of the nature of the ayre, free from all impurities, and abounding with ſhining lights. The ſight (ſay the Platoniſts) which hath for his inſtrument theſe two twinne-borne ſtarres, all full of bright ſtraines and heauenly fire, which giueth light and burneth not, repreſenteth the skie, and hath the light for his obiect. The hearing, which is occupied about nothing but ſounds, hath for his obiect the beaten ayre, and his principall inſtrument (if we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11348:14"/>beleeue <hi>Aristotle</hi>) is a certaine ayre ſhut vp within a little laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. The ſmelling participateth the nature of fire: for ſmels haue their being only in a drie qualitie cauſed through heate, and we receiue it for a principle, that all ſweete ſmelling things are hot. The taſte hath moyſture for his obiect. And handling the earth for his.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The third,</note>Some there be which gather the number of the ſences to bee ſuch, from the conſideration of their vſes, which are their finall ends. The ſences are made for the benefit of man: man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two parts, the body and the ſoule: the ſight and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſerue more for the vſe of the ſoule then of the body: the taſte and touching more for the body then the ſoule: the ſmelling for both the twaine indifferently, refreſhing and purging the ſpirits, which are the principall inſtruments of the ſoule. But of the fiue ſences I ſay that there are two altogether neceſſary and required, to cauſe the being and life ſimply: and that the three other ſerue onely for a happie being and life. Thoſe without which one can not be, are taſte and touching. Touching (if we will giue credit to natural Philoſophers) is as the foundation of liuelihood (I will vſe this word, becauſe it expreſſeth the thing very excellently). The taſte ſerueth for the preſeruation of the life. The ſight, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſmelling ſerue but for to liue well and pleaſantly. For the creature may be and continue without them. The two firſt (for that they were altogether neceſſarie) haue their meane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſo ioyned to the member, as that it is (as a man would ſay) inſeparable. For in taſting and touching, the Phiſitions doe make the meane and the member all one. The other three haue their meane outward, and ſeparated from the inſtrument, as the ſight hath the ayre, the water, and euery ſuch body as is through cleere, for his meane. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the beginning of his third booke of the ſoule, hath plaid the Philoſopher in more ſerious ſort then
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11348:14"/>any of all theſe, but yet ſo darkly, as that almoſt all his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue found themſelues much buſied to find out his meaning, in ſuch maner, as that he may ſeeme to haue gone about to hide the ſecrets of nature and myſteries of his Philoſophie, not with the vaile of fained fables, as doe the Poets; neither yet with any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious conceit of numbers, as <hi>Pithagoras</hi> his ſect were wont to doe; but by an obſcure breuitie: reſembling the cuttle fiſh, which to the end that ſhe may not fall into the hand of the fiſher, caſteth vp a blackiſh water and ſo hideth her ſelfe.<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> The ſences (ſayth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) are but fiue, becauſe the meanes by which they worke, cannot be altered any moe then fiue wayes.<note place="margin">Ariſtotle his proofe for the number of the ſences.</note> The meanes by which we haue the vſe of our ſences, are onely two, the one is outward, the other is inward: the outward is the ayre or the water: the inward is the fleſh or the membranes. The ayre and water do receiue the obiects that are outward, either as they are tranſparent, and then they ſerue the ſight; or as they are moueable and thin bodies, and then they ſerue the hearing; or as moiſt ones doe receiue and embrace that which is drie, and then they be the ſubiects of ſmelling. The fleſh or membranes may be conſidered of two maner of wayes; either according to the temperature of the foure elementall qualities, and then they bee the ſubiects of feeling; or els according to the mixture of the qualities drie and moyſt, and then they are the ſubiects of reliſhes for the taſte. But howſoeuer the caſe ſtandeth for the reaſon of this number, we ſee there are but fiue externall ſences, which are all placed without the braine. Theſe are the proper poſts and meſſengers of the ſoule; theſe are the windowes by which wee ſee cleerely round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vs. Theſe are the watch or doore keepers which make vs way into their moſt priuie cloſet: if they performe their faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto reaſon, then do they ſet before her a million of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome obiects, whereof ſhe frameth marueilous diſcourſes. But (alas and woe is me) how oft doe they betray her? Oh how many dangers do they inwrap her in, and how ſubiect are they vnto cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?</p>

If thou giue thine eare to hearken vnto theſe craftie tongues and cogging ſpeeches, vnto theſe cunning diſcourſes full of honie, and a thouſand other baits, doubt not, but that thy reaſon wil be ſurpriſed: for the ſcout watch being fallen aſleepe, the enemie ſtealeth vpon them ſoftly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth maſter of the fort.

Firſt therefore it is out of all doubt,<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> that the ſight cauſeth vs to know greater varietie and more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of things, then any of the reſt of the ſences. For all naturall bodies are viſible and may bee ſeene, but all of them cannot bee felt, neither doe they all affoord ſmels, taſts or ſounds: the heauen, the worlds ornament, and moſt noble ſubſtance amongſt all the reſt, will not ſuffer vs to touch the ſame; neither can we heare the ſweete harmonie which proceedeth of the concords and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſo many diuerſe motions. There is nothing but the ſight which acquainteth vs therewithall: ſoft bodies make no ſound; neither is there any taſte in the earth or fire, and yet euery one of theſe may bee ſeene. The ſight, beſides his owne proper obiect, which is colour, hath an infinit ſort of others, as greatnes, number, proportion, motion, reſt, ſituation and diſtances. And this is the cauſe why the Philoſopher in his Metaphyſiques calleth it the ſence of inuention, as for that by the meanes thereof, all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Sciences and Arts haue been inuented and found out. By the meanes of this noble ſence, it came firſt to paſſe that man ſhould begin to play the Philoſopher: for Philoſophie was not begot, but by admiring of things; and admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſprung not from elſwhere, then from the ſight of pleaſant and beautifull things. Whereupon the minde raiſing it ſelfe on hie toward heauen, and rauiſhed with the conſideration of ſo many marueilous things, was deſirous to know the cauſe of them, and thereupon began to play the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher. And yet I will ſay further, that the ſight is the ſence of our bleſſednes. For the chiefe felicitie of man conſiſteth in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. But there is none of the other ſences that giueth vs better directions for the ſame, then the ſight.

Lift vp thy ſight vp on high from whence thou haſt taken thy beginning. Behold the throne of his Maieſtie, which is heauen, the moſt complet and fully furniſhed of all his corporall and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible workes: looke vpon ths infinite number of burning fires in the ſame, and among the reſt, thoſe two great flames which ſhew vs light, the one by day, and the other by night.

If thou be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to looke vp to Heauen, for feare of being conſtrained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe a Deitie, then caſt downe thine eyes vpon the waters or earth: ſee and marke in the Sea a great wonder, how continually it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the earth, and yet neuer ouerfloweth it: how it ſwalloweth vp all the riuers of the world, and ſwelleth neuer a whit the more, neither hath it been ſeene thereby to paſſe his limits. Weigh with thy ſelfe how the earth hangeth in the ayre, and ſo beareth vp it ſelfe, notwithſtanding the huge maſſines of the ſame. Call to minde the differences of liuing creatures, which are all moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their kindes; the beautie of ſtones; the infinite number of plants, the which are not leſſe variable, then admirable for their properties. If all this cannot ſtir thee vp to the acknowledgement of this firſt and principall cauſe; if thy delight draw thee away, and ſteale from thee that time which thou oughteſt to ſpend in the due conſideration of ſuch a manifold varietie, then come hither, I will ſhew thee in leſſe then nothing, the ſumme and briefe of the great world; the head and chiefe of all that euer God wrought;

I will not at this time ſet before thine eyes any more then the head, in as much as the cleere ſignes and markes of the diuine nature doe ſhine therein moſt euidently. View well this royall palace within, without, and throughout; behold the cunning workemanſhip of the braine, the three pillars which beare vp the roofe of this magnificent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as an <hi>Atlas</hi> ſupporting the Heauens with his ſhoulders: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde alſo his foure cloſets or cels, wherein the principall powers of the minde (if we will beleeue the <hi>Arabians</hi>) are lodged, as for example, the imagination in the two formoſt, the reaſon in the middlemoſt, and the memorie in that which is hindermoſt: ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue moreouer his chriſtallike cleere looking glaſſe, his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable net, which like to an intricate labyrinth is wouen of a million of ſmall arteries, interlaced and wrought one within another, in which the ſpirits are prepared and refined; the originall of ſinews, the ſiluer thred, and his incredible fecunditie in the bringing forth of ſinewes; the chanels and water pipes, through which the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the braine are purged. But and if thou will not be kept vp within this royall pallace, come forth and thou ſhalt ſee in the forepart of the head theſe two bright ſhining Starres, the two loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſes of the Soule, as thoſe that ſhadow out vnto vs all the paſſions of the ſame: thou wilt admire their beautifull chriſtalline humor, which is more cleere and pure, then any orientall pearles; the polliſhed and exquiſite garniſh of the coats, the marueilous nimblenes of the muſcles, but eſpecially of the amorous pulley. On the ſides thou ſhalt ſee the eares, which will no leſſe aſtoniſh thee: for is it not a wittie exploite of nature to cloſe vp in ſo ſmall a hole, a drumme hard laced, hauing on the hinder part two ſmall ſtrings, and three little bones, reſembling a forge, a hammer and a ſtirrop, three ſmall muſcles, and a labyrinth contayning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ayre; two windowes, round, after the faſhion of an egge, one nerue, and one griſtlie veſſell, which ſtretching it ſelfe to the roofe of the mouth, cauſeth that goodly ſympathie or mutuall ſuffering, which is betwixt the inſtruments of hearing and ſpeaking?

                  <note place="margin">The ſecond proofe of the excellencie of the ſight.</note>The ſecond poynt, declaring vnto vs the excellencie of the ſight, is the meanes of his operation, which is altogether liuely: for the ſight performeth his office at an inſtant, and that in places farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued and diſtant, without mouing it ſelfe from place to place. I intend (to the end that euery one may know the perfection of this ſence) to compare the ſame, and make it like vnto the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Euen as the vnderſtanding part of the minde receiueth from. the imaginatiue the formes of things naked and voide of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:<note place="margin">A comparing of the ſight and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding together.</note> euen ſo the ſight is the ſubiect of formes without bodie, which the Philoſophers call intentionals. The vnderſtanding comprehendeth the vniuerſall world, no place or roome in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding taken vp, or any whit more peſtered thereby, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth Heauen and earth, without any maner of incumbrance from the one to the other ſo contained therein: the ſight compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth alſo the Heauen, without admitting of any place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; the hugeſt mountaines in the world doe enter all at once, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11348:17"/>that vndiminiſhed through the apple of the eye, without any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of offence through ſtraitnes of entrance. The vnderſtanding iudgeth at one and the very ſame time of two contraries, as of right and wrong, placeth them indifferently in it ſelfe, attaineth to the knowledge of the one by the other, and bandeth them vnder one and the ſame ſcience. The eye at one inſtant receiueth and is occupied about blacke and white, and diſtinguiſheth them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, the knowledge of the one being no maner of impeachment to the knowledge of the other, being y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the other ſences are not capable of. For if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue taſted any bitter thing, his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to iudge aright at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſame inſtant of that which is ſweet will faile, &amp; deceiue him. The vnderſtanding in a moment whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth round about the world: the ſight likewiſe receiueth at one inſtance of time the whole widenes of heauen. All the other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe moue by intercourſe of time. And this is the reaſon why men ſee the lightning, before they heare the thunder, although that neither of them bee made before or after other. The vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is free of it own nature, and hath a will either to diſcourſe or not to diſcourſe: The ſight in his function hath as it were a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of libertie, which nature hath denied vnto the other ſences. The eares are alwaies open; ſo as the noſe is alſo, the skinne is alwaies ſubiect vnto cold and heate and other the iniuries of the ayre: but the eyes haue eyelids which open and ſhut when wee will, for the furtherance or ſtaying of our ſight, as beſt ſhall pleaſe our ſelues.</p>
               <p>The third thing which I haue to teſtifie the excellencie of the ſight, is the certaintie of the function. For it is out of all doubt that this is the moſt infallible ſence, and that which leaſt deceiueth: according to that which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are wont to ſay, when they wil aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly auouch any thing, namely, that they ſee it with their owne eyes. And the prouerbe vſed amongſt men of olde time, is moſt true, that it is better to haue a witnes which hath ſeene the thing, then ten which ſpeake but by heare ſay. <hi>Thales</hi> the Mileſian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaid, that there was as much difference betwixt ſight and hearing; as betwixt true and falſe. The Prophets themſelues to confirme the trueth of their propheſies, called them by the name of viſions, as being moſt true and certaine things. Finally, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11348:18"/>of the ſight appeareth in his particular obiect,<note place="margin">The third proofe of the excellencie of the ſight.</note> which is the moſt noble, common and beſt knowne of all others: I call it the moſt noble, becauſe it is endowed with the goodlieſt qualitie that is in the whole world (that is to ſay) the light, which is of an heauenly ofſpring, and which the Poets call the eldeſt daughter of God. I call it the commoneſt, becauſe in differently it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth it ſelfe vnto all. And I call it the beſt knowne of vs, in as much as all other naturall bodies do more or leſſe conſiſt of mixt colour: and for that there cannot be any part therof in the world, but that it will be attained and gotten by ſight. Let vs then ſay with <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> that the ſight is as it were the forme and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of man: with the Stoikes, that the ſight maketh vs to draw neere vnto the diuine nature: and with the Philoſopher <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> that it ſeemeth that we were borne onely to ſee.</p>

But if it may be granted me to mixe one dram of Phiſick amongſt the large maſſe of theſe Philoſophicall and Poeticall ſentences, I dare auouch that in the eyes wee perceiue and diſcerne, the whole eſtate of the health of the bodie.<note place="margin">That the eyes doe ſhew the whole eſtate of mans health.</note>

The Lawyers doe hold it as a Maxime, that a blind man cannot plead or handle a caſe well, becauſe he cannot ſee the maieſtie of the Iudge. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlotle</hi> that light of nature, in his ſecond booke of the generation of liuing things, ſayth, that from the eyes men take infallible ſignes

The eyes (ſayth the ſame Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher) are full of ſpirit and ſeede: and this is the reaſon, why in new married perſons, they bee ſo much the leſſer and as it were languiſhing. But what neede I to alleadge ſo many proofes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the excellencie of theſe two Sunnes, ſeeing that nature her ſelfe doth ſufficiently demonſtrate the ſame vnto vs?

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The names of the eye.</note>The Grecians call the eyes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe they make vs ſee, and the Poets affirme that they are the children of the Nymph <hi>Thea.</hi> The Hebrewes haue called them by the name of <hi>High,</hi> to put vs in minde from whence we ſprung, as alſo to teach vs, that our eyes muſt ſerue vs to behold the things which are high. The Latines call them <hi>Oculi,</hi> becauſe they are as it were hidden and incloſed within a hollow valley.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The forme of the eye.</note>The ſhape and figure of the eye is round, but not euery way: for it is ſomewhat long and ſteeple faſhioned, hauing his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion outward, and his top inward towards the ſinew of ſight. This figure was moſt agreeable vnto it,<note place="margin">The cauſe of the roundnes of the eye.</note> to the end it might containe much, moue nimbly, and free it ſelfe of offered iniuries. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians doe maintaine, that the ſphericall figure is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11348:20"/>moſt apt to containe much: and <hi>Ophthalmists</hi> do confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme, that if the eye had not been round, it could neuer haue comprehended the hugenes of great bodies, neither yet could euer haue ſeene at one time many obiects, becauſe that no man can ſee but by a direct line. On what ſide ſoeuer then that the eye turneth it ſelfe, many lines doe offer themſelues at once to the apple of the eye which is round: but this could not by any meanes come to paſſe if it were flat or foureſquare. This circular ſhape doth alſo ſerue the eye, that it may moue the more nimbly and eaſily, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee vpward or downward, to the right hand, or to the left, or circularly: for ſphericall bodies doe moue as it were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, being ſtayed and reſting onely vpon a narrow poynt. And I conceiue this roundnes not to bee vnprofitable for the defence of the eye: for amongſt all the ſorts of figures the ſphericall or round figure is the ſtrongeſt, and withſtandeth the aſſaults of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hurts and harmes, becauſe it is all alike, and hath no vneue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in it: therein a man ſhall neither finde corner nor poynt, which may worke the ruine and diſſolution of the ſame. The eyes are ſeated vpon high in the body, in the forepart thereof,<note place="margin">The ſituation of the eye.</note> and as it were in a valley. Vpon high, to diſcouer from a farre, and to keepe that nothing may aſſaile vs at vnwares: they ſerue the creature for ſpies and watches, and are oftentimes called <hi>Phares</hi> in the holie Scripture.<note place="margin">The cauſe why they be ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on high.</note> But watchmen are vſually wont to bee placed in ſuch plots as doe ouerlooke all the reſt: and no man aſsigneth any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place to the lanterne, but the top of the tower and higheſt place of the ſhip. They are ſet in the forepart of euery creature ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then behinde,<note place="margin">And the cauſe why before.</note> becauſe that euery liuing thing moueth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: by which meanes it hath the oportunitie to ſpie out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer might offend it: and indeede it is not at any time permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the watch, to ſtand with their backs or blind ſides toward the enemie. Such as write of Anatomie, ſay, that it was neceſſary to place the eyes forward: for that the ſight had great need of a verie ſoft and marrowiſh ſinew, that by it vpon the ſudden there might great ſtore of ſpirits bee brought vnto the eyes: and that ſuch ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes cannot poſſibly bee found to put forth backward, ſeeing that way there is none that ſpread themſelues, but ſuch as are too hard and drie. I my ſelfe haue elſewhere approued this reaſon,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11348:21"/>but hauing afterward obſerued, that all the nerues doe riſe from the hinder part of the braine, and hauing ſeene the optickes to riſe alſo from thence as well as the reſt, I was enforced to chaunge mine opinion.<note place="margin">The cauſe why they be ſet in a hollow place.</note> Finally, the eyes are faſtned within a little hollow pit (which the common people call a collet) for their better ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and to preuent the prodigall expence of ſpirits. This little val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley is fortified and entrenched on euery ſide, either with the brow bone, or with the bone of the noſe, or the cheeke-bone, all which are raiſed round about the ſame in maner of little hillockes: and and for that the forepart was without any thing to couer it, nature hath ſhut it in with a lid, which openeth and ſhutteth at our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for feare that the eye ſhould bee corrupted and turned from his nature, either by the offence of too much light; or leaft that it being alwais open, his ſpirits ſhould ſpend and quite vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; or leaſt in ſleeping, it might bee hurt by outward cauſes. To which cauſes I will yet adde one other of mine owne, which is, that if the eye ſhould neuer ſhut, and thereby the ſpirits vnceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly be gazing vpon the light, it would come to paſſe that they would bee vnable to withdraw themſelues ſo ſpeedily into their center, and our ſleepe would neuer be ſo peaceable :for the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers are of opinion, that ſleepe is cauſed by the retraction of the ſpirits into their ſecret and inner roomes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſubſtance of the eye.</note>The nature of the eye, which men call in anatomic all tearmes the ſubſtance of the eye, is altogether ſoft, bright and ſhining cleere, thicke and wateriſh: ſoft that ſo it may readily admit and receiue the formes of things: ſhining and through cleere, that ſo the light may pearce it through, as alſo that thereby the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may haue ſome correſpondencie with his obiect: thicke, to the end that his obiects may haue, wherin the better to reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Now it is the water alone, that can haue all theſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: whereupon it commeth to paſſe that the eye is of a wateriſh ſubſtance, and not of a fierie ſubſtance, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayd: which thing I ſhall handle more largely in the 10. chapter.</p>
               <p>The vſe of the eye is double:<note place="margin">The vſe.</note> the one is to ſerue as a guide and watch to diſcouer whatſoeuer might annoy, and this is common to all liuing creatures: the other is proper to man alone, being to teach him the knowledge of God by the things that are viſible,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11348:21"/>to perfect his vnderſtanding, and thirdly to conſummate his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines: for by the ſight man is made partaker of the beautie of the heauen, by which meanes his vnderſtanding part is much beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and inriched, and he himſelfe made as it were like vnto his Creator.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The number.</note>The eyes are two, and that becauſe of the excellencie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie of this ſence, that thereby the one might ſerue, if that the other were either diſeaſed or vtterly loſt. They be alſo two in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the better perfecting of the ſight, for by that meanes a man may ſee many things at once: for if that man had but one eye, and that placed in the middeſt of the forehead, as the Poets faine of the Cyclops, wee ſhould onely ſee the things right afore vs, and not thoſe which ſhould be on either ſide. Theſe two eyes, although they bee farre enough ſeparated the one from the other,<note place="margin">That they can not moue the one without the other.</note> haue ſuch a fellow-feeling, and doe ſo well agree the one with the other in their actions, as that the one of them cannot moue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or otherwiſe then the other: for it is not in our abilitie, to looke vp with the one and downe with the other, or els to ſtir the one and hold the other ſtill.<note place="margin">Ariſtotle his error.</note> 
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> imputeth this to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of the ſinewes of ſight, and is perſwaded that the eyes doe moue together, becauſe they haue the originall and principal cauſe of their motion, which is found to be in the coniunction of the ſinew of ſight: common. But this worthie man deceiueth himſelf in this, as he is ouertaken almoſt in al other things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath to doe concerning Anatomie. The nerue optick med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not at all with the motion of the eye, it onely bringeth the ſpirit of ſight: for being ſtopped in the diſeaſe called <hi>Gutta Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the ſight is quite loſt, and yet the motion thereof abideth ſtil. It behoueth vs therefore to attribute the cauſe thereof, to the end and perfection of this ſence. The eyes muſt moue together, that ſo the obiects thereof may not ſeeme double. For if wee could looke vp with the one and downe with the other, at one and the ſame time, this ſence which is the worthieſt of all the reſt, ſhould euermore delude it ſelfe and become moſt imperfect, in as much as euery ſingle thing that it ſhuld behold, would appeare double: the proofe whereof may eaſily be had, if with thy finger thou force the one of thine eyes either higher or lower then the other.</p>

If the chriſtalline humor be very bright, cleere and ſubtile, if alſo it be large, and placed forward in the eye, the eye will ſeeme fierie and ſparkeling; if contrariwiſe it be duskiſh, groſſe, and ſet very much inwardly, the eye will ſhew blacke or browne: the grape-like tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, being oftentimes of diuerſe colours, is alſo a cauſe of this varietie, and the ſpirits doe not a little further and ſerue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſame.</p>

The certaine number of theſe tunicles is not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded of: for ſome make moe, and ſome fewer. <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> doth acknowledge but foure, <hi>Galen</hi> hath obſerued fiue,<note place="margin">That there are but fiue tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or coats.</note> and the Anatomiſts of our time make vp the number of nine. As for my ſelfe, hauing with all carefulnes peruſed the leaues of this booke of nature, I cannot finde any more then ſixe, which are, the white, the hornie, the grape-like, cobweb-like net-like and glaſſie coate. For whereas ſome doe count of one that ſhould be like vnto the eye-bries; it is nothing elſe but an appendant part of the vitreous: as that which they call the hard coate, is a parcell of the hornie. As concerning the ninth, which is made of the endes of the muſcles, there is no ſhew of reaſon, why it ſhould be called a tunicle proper to the eye. For if this were graunted, it would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo follow, that the common membrane which couereth the muſcles of the eye, ſhould be graced with the ſame priuiledge. The firſt therefore and largeſt of all the reſt,<note place="margin">That the white tunicle is the firſt.</note> is called the white coate, or the white of the eye, or otherwiſe the coniunctiue mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane: I ſay nothing in this place of the greeke and latine names, for that a man may ſee them in mine Anatomie. This tunicle is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, and riſeth from the edges of <hi>Pericranium:</hi> it compaſſeth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11348:24"/>not the eye round about, or euery where: for it endeth at the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle called <hi>Iris,</hi> by reaſon of the varietie of the colours thereof. I confeſſe that there are three vſes of this coate.<note place="margin">The threefold vſe of the ſame</note> The firſt whereof is, that it letteth all annoyance which might happen to the eye, by the hardnes of the bones about it. The ſecond, to hold the eye firme, leaſt that either by ſome maner of exceſſe, or els ſome ouer violent motion, it ſhould fall out of his place. The third and laſt, is to ſtand faſt vnto al the ſixe muſcles, as whereupon they ſhould not faile to finde ſure footing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The hornie membrane.</note>The ſecond membrane is called <hi>Cornea,</hi> or hornie, becauſe it is cleere &amp; poliſhed, as the hornes of lanternes be: or becauſe it may be diuided into many little skins or thinne membranes: it is alſo called hard, becauſe of his hardnes, and for that it commeth from the thicke membrane compaſsing the braine, called <hi>Dura mater.</hi> The ſubſtance thereof is thicke, for the better withſtanding of outward miuries: it is alſo tranſparent or through cleere, that thereby the light may quickly paſſe through it: it is ſmooth, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and without all colour, becauſe that ſeruing as a glaſſe or ſpectacle vnto the chriſtialline humour, it would haue made euery thing which wee ſhould haue looked vpon, to haue been of the ſame colour with it ſelfe, if it had been of any colour at all: this is alſo the cauſe, why there are not any veines or arteries to bee ſeene in it. But if it happen that this skinne grow white, as ſometimes it doth through vlcers in the ſame, or by hauing been ſcorched by ſome hot thing, (in ſuch ſort as the Turkes vſe them which will ſee <hi>Mahomet</hi> his ſepulcher) the ſight is loſt, the glaſſe being darkned. This tunicle ſerueth for three purpoſes.<note place="margin">The threefold vſe of this coat.</note> For firſt it ſerueth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the humours: ſecondly, to compaſſe and keepe them in: and thirdly, to bee in ſtead of a ſpectacle vnto the chriſtalline hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The grapelike coate.</note>The third tunicle is called <hi>Vuea,</hi> being like vnto the skinne of a blacke grape: it is alſo called <hi>Choroides,</hi> becauſe it containeth all the veſſels which ſerue for the nouriſhing of the other coates: or becauſe it commeth from the thin and tender skin compaſsing the braine called <hi>Pia mater,</hi> which is of <hi>Galen</hi> oftentimes called <hi>Choroides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This skinne compaſſeth the eye round about, except before
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:11348:24"/>onely, where being bored through, it maketh a little round hole, which is called the apple, and is the principall window of the eye, which being ſhut in by chataracts, cauſeth vs to line in continuall darknes: and this is the onely coate that is partie-coloured. On the fore ſide it is as it were blacke, thereby to hold together the forme of obiects: on the innermoſt or hinder ſide it is blew, greene, and of many other colours, thereby to refreſh the chriſtalline hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour when it is wearied. This skinne doth notable good ſeruice to the chriſtalline humour, and other parts of the eye.<note place="margin">The offices of Vuea.</note> For firſt it is the meanes to hinder that the hardnes of the hornie membrane ſhould not hurt the chriſtall: then it refreſheth the ſame with the varietie of his colours: thirdly, it keepeth together and hemmeth in the ſpirits, which otherwiſe would ſpend and diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues abroad: and laſtly, doth ſtore with nouriſhment, the hornie and netlike membranes, as alſo the humours: and this is the cauſe why nature hath made it ſoft and full of veſſels.</p>
               <p>The fourth membrane is called <hi>Aranoides,</hi> becauſe it is very fine, and reſembleth the ciper web,<note place="margin">The cobweb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like coate.</note> or threeds which the Spider draweth out with her feete: it couereth and lyeth cloſe vnto the chriſtalline humour, and ſerueth to vnite and retain the formes of things, as the lead doth in looking glaſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The netlike coate.</note>The fift is the netlike tunicle, ouercaſt with a million of little threeds, after the faſhion of a net. It groweth from the ſofteſt part of the ſinew of ſight, which naturally is giuen to dilate and widen it ſelfe: and this is the cauſe why when it is caſt into water, one ſhall perceiue it to be all white, ſoft, and as it were marrowlike. The vſe thereof is to conuey the inward light,<note place="margin">The vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> which is the animall ſpirit, vnto the chriſtalline humour, and to carrie backe againe whatſoeuer receiued formes firſt vnto the nerue optick, and from thence to the braine to iudge thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The glaſſie tunicle.</note>The laſt is called the vitreous or glaſsie tunicle, becauſe it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth and containeth the glaſsie humour. The learned of ancient time haue not knowne it. There is to be ſeene in the midſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a round circle like vnto the eyebrie: I ſuppoſe it to be a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall veines, which conuey blood vnto the ſaid vitreous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that there being laboured, it may be made white and fit for the chriſtalline humour.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oe thus all vailes, ſhadowes and couert being taken away, it is now time to make a plaine and open ſhew of the moſt precious iewell of the eye, that rich diamond, that beautifull chriſtall, which is of more worth then all the pearles of the Eaſt. This is that icelike humour, which is the principall inſtrument of the ſight, the ſoule of the eye, the inward ſpectacle: this is that humour which alone is altered by colours, &amp; receiueth whatſoeuer formes of the things that are to be ſeene. This is that chriſtalline humour, which in more hardie wiſe then <hi>Hercules,</hi> dares to encounter two at one,<note place="margin">That all the parts of the eye are ſeruants to the chriſtalline.</note> namely, the outward and inward light. This is that onely chriſtalline humour, which all the other parts of the eye acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their ſoueraigne, and themſelues the vaſſals thereof: for the hornie tunicle doth the office of a glaſſe vnto it: the apple, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a window: the grapelike coate is as a fayre flowring gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to cheare and reioyce the ſame after weariſome labour: the cobweblike coate ſerueth as lead to retaine ſuch formes as are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: the wateriſh humour as a warlike foreward, to intercept and breake off the firſt charge of the obiects thereof, aſſaying all vpon the ſudden, and with headlong violence to make breach and entrance: The vitreous humour is his cooke, dreſsing and ſetting forth in moſt fit ſort his daily repaſt: The nerue opticke, one of his ordinary meſſengers, carrying from the braine thereto, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and power to ſee, and conueying backe againe with all ſpeede whatſoeuer hath been ſeene: The muſcles are his loftie ſteedes and couragious courſers, whereupon being mounted it aduanceth it ſelfe aloft, caſteth it ſelfe alow, turneth it ſelfe on the right and left hand: and finally in euery ſuch ſort, as ſeemeth beſt vnto it ſelfe. In briefe, this is the principall part of the eye, which I intend to deſcribe, when I ſhall haue ſhewed you that which is before it, I meane the wateriſh humour. All the Anatomiſts agree
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11348:25"/>that there are three humours in the eyes: the wateriſh,<note place="margin">The deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wateriſh humour.</note> the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline, and the glaſsie. The wateriſh, called alſo the white hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, hath this name, becauſe it is of the conſiſtence of water, and is (as it were) like vnto the white of an egge.<note place="margin">Why the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie humour is ſet before the chriſtalline.</note> Nature hath placed it before the chriſtalline to be in ſtead of a rampier, to the end it might not be hurt by the hardnes of the membranes, and that the firſt and fierce aſſaults of obiects, might bee ſomewhat rebated: and in ſuch maner, as that it may ſeeme to be an inward meane to conuey the formes of obiects vnto the chriſtalline humour. And looke how the lungs vndertaketh the firſt encounter of the ayre, and maketh it true fauourite vnto the heart: euen ſo the wateriſh humour altereth the light which commeth from without, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth it to that which is within. This humour ſerueth alſo to water the chriſtalline and to keepe it moyſt: for being drie it can not admit the formes of things. It manageth alſo the ſpirits, which otherwiſe of their owne nature would alwaies be mounting aloft and wandring abroade, and will not ſuffer them in ſuch ſort to ſpend themſelues, being ſet before them as a barre to keepe them in. It alſo keepeth aſunder the grapelike coate and the chriſtalline humour, and ſtretcheth foorth and filleth continually the hornie membrane, that ſo by the withering and ſhrinking thereof the ſight may not bee loſt. This humour hauing all theſe goodly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:<note place="margin">That the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie humour is a part of the eye.</note> it is not very like that it ſhould bee an excrement of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline humour, as <hi>Auicen</hi> the prince of Arabia for Phiſicke hath ſeemed to affirme. And I am ſo farre from being of his minde, as that I take it for a ſpermaticke part, not yeelding any thing in title of elderſhip vnto the chriſtalline, as hauing ouer and beſides his limited proportion or permanent quantitie, his conſtant abiding place, and his double partition-wall of two membranes, keeping it and the chriſtalline aſunder: whereunto may bee added, that (contrary to the nature of an excrement) if it be once loſt or ſpilt, it can neuer be recouered againe, but cauſeth vs to loſe our ſight.</p>
               <p>The next in ſequence is the chriſtalline humour,<note place="margin">The description of the chriſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</note> which is bright and icelike, as is the chriſtall which is pure and well pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. This is the ſteele-glaſſe of the minde, by which it looketh vpon the formes and faces of things, and combineth the lights which before were ſeuerall and aſunder. Some men are of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:11348:26"/>that the inuention and vſe of ſpectacles was taken from the chriſtalline humour, becauſe that if it be laid vpon a written pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it cauſeth the letters to ſhew twice ſo great as they are. The ſubſtance thereof is wateriſh,<note place="margin">The ſubſtance thereof.</note> but it runneth not abroad as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe; it is faſter and more ſolide, to the end that the formes of obiects, may ſettle themſelues therein; it is alſo through-cleere, and full of light, to the end it may haue ſome correſpondencie with his obiect, which is lightſome; it is of no colour, that ſo it may receiue all maner of colours the more indifferently: for if the chriſtalline humour ſhould be tainted either with greene, or red, or yellow, all the obiects thereof would appeare and ſeeme to be of the ſame colour.<note place="margin">Why the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline humor is not nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood.</note> Here we cannot but wonder at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidentnes of nature, which would not haue this chriſtalline to be nouriſhed with blood, as all the other parts of the bodie are, for feare that the blood ſhould make it red, but for the better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hath dedicated vnto it the vitreous humour, to turne his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment into a white colour, and play the part of a cooke, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the neede thereof ſhould require.<note place="margin">His ſhape.</note> The ſhape is round, and yet not altogether and exactly ſphericall, but ſome what flat on the two ſides as is a fetch, or the end of a peſtell: and this is the reaſon why the Grecians haue called it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that it was thus ſhaped, that ſo it might abide more firme, and not to be thruſt out of his place vpon euery violent motion of the eye. For ſuch things as be exquiſitelyround, doe moue (as it were) of themſelues, and haue no ſtay, reſting themſelues but vpon a poynt.<note place="margin">His ſituation.</note> It is placed in the middeſt of the eye, as in his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the end it may equally and indifferently intertaine and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of both the lights. On the hinder part it is vnderlaid with the vitreous humour, and feemoth (as it were) to ſwimme vpon the top of the ſame: on the forepart it hath the wateriſh humour, and round about it is wrapped in his proper coate called <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noides.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The glaſſie humour.</note>The third and laſt humour is called glaſsie, becauſe it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth in colour and conſiſtence the moulten glaſſe. The chiefe vſe thereof is to prepare nouriſhment for the chriſtalline humour, not that the chriſtalline humour ſhould feede vpon it owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as <hi>Auicen</hi> hath thought. For one part is neuer nouriſhed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11348:26"/>or fed of the ſubſtance of another: but this doth blanch or turne white the blood, and ſerue for cooke to the chriſtalline.

               <p>The quantitie thereof is in greater abundance then any of the reſt: it is clothed with his owne coate, which is more then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient learned in this profeſsion did euer attaine vnto to know.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thinke my ſelfe by this time to haue deciphered exactly enough the whole workemanſhip of the eye, and of all his parts, let vs now looke about and ſee how it diſchargeth his function, which is ſight, and how it is accompliſhed.<note place="margin">The things neceſſarie to make vs ſee.</note> All Philoſophers haue well agreed in this one poynt, that there are three things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for to make the ſight perfect: that is to ſay; the inſtrument which is the eye; the obiect, which is the colour; and the meanes inlightned, which is the aire, or the water, or ſome other thorough-cleare and chriſtal-like thing: but when it ſhould come to paſſe that they ſhould ioyne theſe three together, and ſhew the maner of this action, (which is the liuelieſt and briefeſt of all the other ſences) they iarre among themſelues and cannot agree. Some of them would haue that there ſhould iſſue out of the eye bright beames or a certaine light which ſhould reach vnto the obiect, and thereby cauſe vs to ſee it: other ſome would haue it, that the obiect commeth vnto the eye, and that nothing goeth out of the eye: the firſt doe hold that we ſee by emiſſion or hauing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing going forth of the eye, the latter by reception or receiuing of the obiect into the eye. The former ſect doe ordinarily alleage <hi>Plato</hi> as their prince and chiefe pillar:<note place="margin">Plato his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, how that we ſee ſending forth of ſome thing.</note> one of his princip all foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations ſtandeth vpon this, that the eye is all full of light, and of the nature of fire, not ſuch as vſeth to burne and giue light toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither yet that which burneth but giueth no light, but ſuch as giueth light and burneth not, like vnto the celeſtiall fire. This foundation ſeemeth to reſt vpon ſome ſhew of trueth,<note place="margin">The found ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> for the eye being rubbed, (yea though it be when it is moſt darke) doth caſt forth ſome bright ſtreames: and commonly wee ſee the eyes of ſuch as are angrie, all fierce and fierie.<note place="margin">Reaſons to proue the eye to be of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fire.</note> 
                  <hi>Plinie</hi> hath obſerued that <hi>Tyberius Caſar</hi> did make afraid many ſouldiers with his onely looke, it was ſo quicke and full of light. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reporteth that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11348:28"/>one <hi>Antipho,</hi> a yong man, did alwaies ſee his owne image by the reflexe of the bright ſtraines which came forth of his eyes. <hi>Galen</hi> telleth of a ſouldier, who becomming blinde by little and little, perceiued euery day as it were a light to come forth of his eyes, and returned not againe. And doe we not in the night perceiue the Cat, the Woolfe, and many other liuing creatures to haue ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eyes. Moreouer, the more then credible readines and nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the eye, the performance of his actions in a moment, and without local motion, his ſteeple-like ſhape, doe all euidently te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that it is of a ſubtile nature, and full of fire: the eye alſo is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeene to quake through colde, although it be in the colde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſelfe is all on a flame. Finally, it cannot bee denied but that the inſtrument muſt bee ſutable to his obiect, the obiect of ſight is colour, and auncient writers haue defined colour to bee a flame going out of bodies: it is of neceſſitie therefore, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument ſhould be of the ſame nature. If this be true (I meane that the eye is full of fire and ſparkling ſtreames) we ſhalbe forced to beleeue, that the eye ſeeth by emiſsion. This is alſo the moſt common receiued opinion, and that which hath drawen manie great learned Clerkes after it, as <hi>Pithagoras, Empedocles, Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Democritus, Leucippus, Epicurus, Chryſippus, Plato,</hi> and in a maner all others which haue written of the eyes. And now take a viewe of their principal reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons to proue that we ſee, by ſending foorth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note>The Baſiliske by his ſight poy ſoneth all them which looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; women hauing their natural courſes, infect the looking-glaſſes vpon which they caſt their eyes. Some report, that if a Woolfe doe firſt ſee a man, that then ſuch a man will become hoarſe.<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> Men of olde time haue thought, that with the looke one might be bewitched and inchanted, according to the complaint of the Poet: I know not what eye hath bewitched my tender lambes.<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> If a man come neere to one that hath enflamed eyes, and behold him earneſtly which hath red eyes, without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture he ſhall bee troubled with the ſame diſeaſe: all which ſheweth that there commeth ſomething out of the eye. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is it that a great whitenes doth hurt the ſight, but onely for that it waſteth the ſpirits which come forth of the eye? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould the eye grow weake with looking,<note place="margin">The third.</note> but becauſe there
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11348:28"/>commeth out of it too much light, and that all the ſpirits vaniſh and fade away?<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> Whence commeth it that ſuch as would ſee a very little thing a far off, do claſpe their eyes, &amp; halfe cloſe their eyelids? It is not that ſo they may vnite the beames, and ioyne together the ſpirits,<note place="margin">The fift.</note> to the end that afterward they may caſt them out more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly cibly and directly? Go not the Cats on hunting in the night? and then do they caſt out ſome glittering ſtreames.<note place="margin">The ſixt.</note> Furthermore, if we ſhould not ſee by ſending ſomething foorth of the eye, it ſhould ſeeme vnneceſſary that the eye ſhould turne it ſelfe vnto his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, the forme thereof ſhould offer it ſelfe ſufficiently to vs, yea, we ſhould ſee in not ſeeing.<note place="margin">The ſeuenth.</note> If we ſhould ſee onely by taking and receiuing ſomething into our eyes, then great eyes ſhould ſee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſmall ones, becauſe they are the more capable: and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuch eyes as haue large apples ſhould ſee better then thoſe which haue ſmall ones, which is quite contrary to trueth: a ſmall thing ſhould be aſſoone ſeene as a great,<note place="margin">The eight.</note> and it would be as eaſie to ſee a farre off as neere, if the formes be al in the aire. Looke wel (ſay they which write of the eyes) vpon a ſmall needle which hath his point ſtanding vp, yet at the firſt caſt thou ſhalt not diſceme the point: but afterward hauing turned thine eye on the one ſide and the other, thou ſhalt ſee it, becauſe that by ſuch turning, ſome one bright ſtraine or other, will haue met with it: of the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and nature is that which happeneth in ſmal things that are on the earth,<note place="margin">The ninth.</note> a man cannot tell how to behaue himſelfe to ſee them at the firſt daſh. Finally, if we ſee by taking ſomething into the eye, the eye ſhould containe at one and the ſame inſtant two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie things, which is againſt the lawes of nature, neither could it being ſo ſmal containe the greatnes, no nor yet the ſhape of great mountaines: whereupon we muſt needes conclude, that we ſee by ſending forth ſomething. Behold here all the faire and goodly forces on this ſide, which I am now about to pitch and plant in the plaine field: and now let vs goe to view the ſquadrons on the contrary ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The contrary opinions of ſuch as hold that we ſee by taking in ſomething.</note>Chiefe captaine and generall of the ſame is <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whoſe followers be the whole band of the Peripatetikes, as alſo <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoes, Alexander, Themistius,</hi> and an infinite number of others. All theſe hold that wee ſee by receiuing ſomething into the eye,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:11348:29"/>and that there doth nothing goe out of the eye which may helpe vs to ſee, but that either the obiect or the forme there of doth come vnto the eye. The foundation and maine reaſon is cleane contrary vnto that of the Platoniſts: for <hi>Plato</hi> was verilie perſwaded, that the eye was all full of fire, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> maintaineth that the eye is all full of water, and this he demonſtrateth moſt excellently, and therefore accordingly I will doe my endeuour to ſet it out moſt plainely.<note place="margin">A cleere and plaine proofe, that the eye is all of water.</note> The inſtrument of the ſight muſt be thorough cleere, and tranſparent, that is to ſay cleere as chriſtal, to the end there may be ſome likenes betwixt the obiect and the inſtrument, and that there maybe ſome equality betwixt the thing doing, and the thing ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. This principle is cleerely agreed vpon in naturall Philoſophie. But of the things which are chriſtal-like cleere, ſome are of ſubtile and thin bodies, and otherſome are more compact and thicke. The eye was not to be made chriſtal-like cleere and thin, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo it could not haue retained his formes, they would haue ſpeedely paſt away, not finding any reſting place, as doe the bodies which are in the ayre: and the glaſſe it ſelfe which is in looking glaſſes, would neuer make ſhew of any picture or reſemblance, if it were not ſteeled or leaded on the backeſide? Whereupon it followeth that the eye muſt be chriſtallike cleere and thicke. Now of all the elements there is no one that is ſo cleare and thicke beſides the water, for the ayre and fire are in deede cleere, but therewithall thin: it followeth therefore, that the eye is of the nature of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This firme and demonſtratiue argument is vnderpropped by another which cannot be gaineſayd.<note place="margin">Another plains and ſtrong proofe.</note> The chiefe part of the eye is the chriſtallike humor, which is nothing elſe, but a congealed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which hath before it the wateriſh humor, and behinde it the vitreous which doth feede and nouriſh it: if you pearce the eye, you ſhall not perceiue any other thing to come forth but water, ſo that we muſt rather beleeue that the eye is of the nature of water, then of fire.<note place="margin">Reaſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that we ſee by taking in ſomething.</note> This foundation thus laid, it will be eaſie to make ſure the reſt of the building, and to maintaine that we ſee by receiuing of ſome thing into the eye; and the rather, becauſe it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of moiſt things to receiue and take in. Loe here the chiefeſt reaſons of this ſect as they follow. The action of euery ſence is a ſuffering, and to doe the office of any of the ſences, is nothing elſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:11348:29"/>but to ſuffer:<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> euery action therefore of the ſences is accompliſhed by receiuing, and not by ſending forth of anything, which is an action; as for example the eare heareth by receiuing of ſounds; ſmelling, by receiuing of odours; taſte, by receiuing of taſtes; and feeling,<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> by receiuing of ſuch qualities as may be felt: and then why ſhould the eye be debarred of this receite? <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, that they which haue their eyes very moyſt, doe ſeeme to ſee things bigger then in deede they bee, which argueth that the formes of things are receiued into, and as it were, grauen in the chriſtalline humor: for bodies ſeeme alwaies to exceede themſelues in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, being within the water. Euery obiect exceeding in his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">The third.</note> doth deſtroy his ſence, as an exceeding great whitenes doth dimme and daſle the ſight: then it muſt follow, that it is violently receiued. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Problemes moueth a queſtion,<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> which may be of ſome force in this place: as, wherefore the right hand is ordinarilie more nimble and ſtrong then the left, and not one care giuen to heare more readilie then the other? Whoſe anſwer is, that the facultie which cauſeth the hands to moue, ſetteth it ſelfe on worke, and that that which cauſeth ſight and hearing is ſet on worke: in ſuch ſort as that the eyes and cares may equally receiue and ſuffer. Olde men commonly doe ſee things a farre off,<note place="margin">The fift.</note> better then thoſe which are at hand, and this cannot happen of any fierie ſtreames or light, going out of the eye, becauſe that thoſe in them are of ſmall quantitie, and greatly delayed with darkenes; the cauſe muſt needes be referred to the forme, which comming from a thing farre remoued, becommeth more fine and ſubtile, and leſſe participating of materiall ſubſtance, and by conſequent no more fit to be receiued.<note place="margin">The ſixt.</note> In winter if the weather be calme and faire, the Starres are often ſeene at midday; which neuer hapneth in ſummer; which is, becauſe in winter the ayre being more groſſe and thicke, the formes thereof doe conſiſt and abide more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, as alſo in greater number in the ayre: but in ſummer by reaſon of the thinnes and ſubtilenes of the ayre, their ſaide formes, haue no ſtaide abode or meanes to multiplie: and this ſheweth, that we ſee by receiuing in, and not ſending forth of any thing. Finally, the eye is like vnto the looking glaſſe,<note place="margin">The ſeuenth.</note> and this receiueth all ſuch ſhapes as are brought vnto it, without ſending any thing of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:11348:30"/>it owne vnto the obiect. They differ onely in this, that the looking glaſſe hath no power to recommend his formes and ſhapes vnto their iudge, as the eye doth vnto the common ſence by the nerue opticke. Loe here the two battels orderly in array, and right ouer one againſt the other, I could wiſh my ſelfe able to agree them, being the ſame that <hi>Galen</hi> hath attempted, but in deede there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle likeliehoode. For the trueth cannot vphold and defend two things,<note place="margin">The Author his opinion.</note> contrary one to the other. I will therefore ſet in foote with the ſtronger ſide, and maintaine with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that wee ſee by receiuing only and that there goeth nothing out of the eye, which may ſerue for the making of vs to ſee. I will vſe for my firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter this reaſon, which as it ſeemeth me is ſharpe enough. If there goe any thing out of the eye, it is either ſome fine and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile bodie,<note place="margin">Arguments plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing the Platoniſts.</note> as the animall ſpirit, or els ſome ſtreame onely. If it be a bodie, how can it bee carried forthwith and in a moment as high as heauen, ſeeing that euery bodily ſubſtance requireth time to moue in, but the ſight is finiſhed at one inſtant? This bodily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhal it not be beaten, ſcattered and deceiued by the winds, before it come to the obiect? This bodie thus going forth of the eye, ſhal it pearce the ayre? or ſhal the ayre giue place to it? pearce it cannot, becauſe that nature can no more abide the pearcing of bodies, then ſhe can abide that there ſhould bee a place wherein ſhould bee no bodie: if the ayre make way for it, then there will neuer be any ſight: for ſo the coherence and continuitie of ſtraines would bee interrupted, becauſe the ayre would follow it hard at the heeles, and thruſt it ſelfe betwixt the two. If to auoyde the puſh of theſe pikes,<note place="margin">That it cannot bee any bright beame which goeth out of the eye.</note> which yet are ſharpe enough, thou wouldeſt ſay, that that which goeth out of the eye is a bright beame or light, which pearceth the ayre, and communicateth it ſelfe in a moment with all that which is the meane, as doth the ſhine of the Sunne, which inlighteneth the whole ayre without any motion; I will vrge thee more neerely, and will cauſe thee to ſee that there is not light enough in the eye to reach vp to heauen. Marke well and conſider, that a flame of fire caſteth not his ſtreames any further then the proportion of the bignes there of will beare it out: one candle cannot giue light enough to one whole parlour, and how canſt thou imagine that this little member ſhould bee able in a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11348:30"/>moment to reach heauen with his bright beames? It is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie for the Sunne, becauſe it is as great as the whole earth, to caſt forth his beames, and to ſpread them ouer the whole world, but it cannot bee ſo ſayd of the eye. Therefore there can nothing goe forth of the eye, that can reach to the things to be ſeene. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if the ſtreames going foorth of the eye ſhould bee the cauſe of ſight, then they ſhould returne vnto the eye againe, or els ſtay by the way: if they come not backe againe, neither can they make returne of ſuch bodies as they touch; if they do come back againe, yet there is nothing but bright glittering bodies, which can bee ſeene, becauſe no other then theſe giue any reflexion, and ſo it ſhould follow, that huge and great hils ſhould not bee ſeene. Let vs ſay more, that if theſe ſtreames ſerue to cauſe vs to ſee, that then of neceſsitie, they muſt either returne emptie or laden with their backes full of bodies: if they come emptie, there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſee: if they bring formes or ſemblances of things with them, then haue wee our deſire, that is, that wee ſee by receiuing ſomething into the eye.<note place="margin">The ground-proofes of the Platoniſts.</note> As concerning the foundations of the Platoniſts, it is eaſie to ouerthrow them all. I confeſſe that the eye hath great quantitie of brightnes in it, but it proceedeth not from fire, it commeth of the chriſtalline humour, and of the ſhining of the tunicles: for all poliſhed ſubſtances, being after the maner of the hornie membrane, doe ſhine in the darke. The action of the eye performed on the ſudden, and the great quicknes of the ſame, cannot compell me to thinke that it is full of fire. For, the action is ſudden, becauſe the eye receiueth but the bare ſhapes or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of things without matter and bodie. For the nimblenes and dexteritie thereof, we may conceiue that it is no great peece of worke for ſixe muſcles readily to moue ſo ſmall a member. The eyes doe not at any time quiuer with colde, becauſe (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſayth in his Problemes) they bee full of fat, which accidentarilie doth keepe them warme, as our garments doe vs: or becauſe they be in continual motion. There is no fire then within the eyes, there is nothing to be found but water, chriſtall and glaſſe.<note place="margin">Anſwere to the reaſons of the Platoniſts.</note> And as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſons which they alleage, they be very light: for the Baſilisk and the inflamed eye do not infect vs by the bright beames which come from them, but by a naturall ſubſtance, which is very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11348:31"/>that is to ſay by a vapour inſenſiblie breathing out of the whole bodie, which infecting the ayre, is by it tranſported to vs. That which is alleaged of the wolfe,<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> is no better worth then to bee derided. And as for any inchantment proceeding from the eye, we hold, that naturally there can no ſuch thing bee. Exceeding much whitenes doth ouerthrow the ſight, becauſe it draweth out all the ſpirits, which ought to keepe within the eye, to enable it the more vnto the performance of his office.<note place="margin">The third.</note> The eye groweth weake and wearie with looking, as euery other part will doe, which is, for that the naturall heate and ſpirits (which labour and take paines in the motion of the eye, as alſo in the holding of the ſame ſtill) doe ſpend and waſte themſelues.<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> Wee doe halfe ſhut our eyes, when we would ſee a farre off, not to the end to vnite the ſhining ſtraines of the eye but rather that the outward light ſhould not ſuddenly ruſh in and ſcatter the inward.<note place="margin">The fift.</note> The eye muſt needes turne it ſelfe towards his obiect, becauſe ſight doth neuer act but by a direct line.<note place="margin">The ſixt.</note> Great eyes, and thoſe apples of eyes which are broad, ſee not ſo well as the contrary, becauſe the inward ſpirits are thereby loſt, being very neceſſary in the receiuing of thoſe formes which are to enter into the eye.<note place="margin">The ſeuenth.</note> As concerning the needle, I anſwere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that at the firſt wee ſee not the poynt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it is not proportionable. The receiuing of two contraries and of the moſt huge mountains,<note place="margin">The eight.</note> is no abſurditie, ſeeing the eye in all caſes medleth with nothing but the formes of the things, which are without all matter and ſubſtance. Wherfore let nothing let vs to conclude, that the ſight is effected by the receiuing in of ſome thing.<note place="margin">A plainer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of the maner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing in ſomething.</note> But the maner of this receiuing is a very difficult thing, and vnderſtood of a very few. To make plaine therefore the ſame, I will doe my indeuour to ſearch out, what it is that the eye receiueth; in what part it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſame; when it receiueth in any thing and how. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt poynt,<note place="margin">What it is that the ſight recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth or taketh in.</note> I finde great oddes in opinions. <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Leucippus</hi> doe firmely hold, that wee receiue in bodies more ſmall then that they will ſuffer any diuiſion. <hi>Epicurus</hi> thinketh that we receiue in the only beames of the obiect. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Peripatetick, the image of the obiect, and that not as in his proper ſubiect, but as it were in a looking-glaſſe. <hi>Aristotle</hi> maintaineth, that we receiue in nothing but the forme which is produced of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11348:31"/>obiect, and multiplied or continued in an vnſeparable continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in and by the ayre, as the bodie maketh and produceth the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the Sunne the light. And this is the ſoundeſt iudgement of all the reſt, but ſuch as needeth a plainer declaration:<note place="margin">That the eye receiueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the formes of things.</note> for euery man is not able at the firſt bluſh, to vnderſtand what is meant by the forme of the obiect. We affirme then that this forme hath not his ſeate and place in the vnderſtanding, as alſo that it is not the ſame which ſchoolemen call <hi>Ens rationis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What this forme is.</note> but that it is a certaine reall thing ſeated in the ayre and eye. Now whatſoeuer hath a reall being, is either a ſubſtance or an accident. This forme cannot be a ſubſtance, becauſe that thereby it ſhould be more noble and perfect then his obiect which is colour. Then it is an accident. But what kinde a one? Shall we call it a quantitie? No, for then it would haue the allowance either of height, bredth or depth: and we dare not call it a relation, becauſe relation hath not the force to doe any thing, but this forme cauſeth vs to ſee. And leaſt of all may wee reduce and bring it vnto the predicament of Action: It muſt then needes bee a qualitie, without matter or bodie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of all maner of diuiſion: ſuch a forme is called of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers intentionall, which hath reſpect vnto the obiect, and is immediatly produced and made ſhew of, as the ſhadow of the bodie. This forme doth multiplie it ſelfe throughout the ayre: for the ayre being ſubtile &amp; moyſt, is apt to receiue all the formes: and receiuing one part of the obiect, repreſenteth the whole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. This forme is not ſeene, but maketh vs to ſee, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the obiect which can be ſeene.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11348:32"/>and hence it is that we ſee a thing in a moment, and not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſsion of time, as al the other ſences haue their operations and actions.<note place="margin">In what part of the eye this receipt is made.</note> Now let vs ſee in what place, that is, whereabout or in what part of the eye this forme is receiued. Some there are which thinke it to be receiued in the braine, becauſe it is the ſeate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, and for that there is none of the ſences which hath not his originall from the braine. <hi>Auicen</hi> did verely thinke, that this receipt was where the nerues optickes doe ioyne together, and that the obiect doth not appeare double, becauſe the formes are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in this coniunction of the ſinewes. Others are of minde, that this receipt is accompliſhed in the cobweb-like tunicle, which is more cleere and bright then any looking-glaſſe. But we hold with <hi>Aristotle, Galen,</hi> and the trueth alſo, that this receipt is effected in the chriſtalline humour, becauſe this is the moſt noble part of the eye, hauing ſuch a ſubſtance as none other hath, and the ſame ſeated in the middeſt of the inſtrument, as in his center, where the two lights doe meete each other; the outward, which entreth at the apple of the eye, as at a window; and the inward, which is brought thither by the nerue optick. Notwithſtanding, if thou bee diſpoſed to reconcile all theſe ſeuerall opinions,<note place="margin">The true and proper meanes by which we haue ſight.</note> thou maiſt ſay that the receipt is made in the chriſtalline humour, the rebating of their violence in the tunicles, the perfect conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the coniunction of the nerues optickes, the knowledge, triall, or diſcerning of the ſame in the ſubſtance of the braine. Of all this long diſcourſe theſe are the fruites which we ſhall reape; that the ſight is effected onely by receiuing of ſome thing into the eye, and not by ſending any thing out of it; that the chriſtalline humour (being the chiefe inſtrument of ſight) receiueth nothing but formes, which are as the ſhadowes of things that may bee ſeene; that theſe formes being produced and multiplied along throughout the ayre, are by a direct line and not elſe receiued, and that at an inſtant. I am conſtrained to adde this diſputation in this ſmall treatiſe of the eye, as hauing been vrgently preſſed, or rather expreſſely commanded to doe the ſame.</p>

For we holde it for a principle in phiſicke, that no man can know that which happeneth contrarie to nature in any part, if he doe not firſt know that which is naturall vnto the ſame part. The direct (ſaith <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his firſt booke of the ſoule) or ſtraight line, is a rule both to iudge it ſelfe and the crooked by. It behooueth then that the Phiſition ſhould know the naturall ſtate of the eye, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is needefull for the execution of his office, if ſo be he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know how many waies it may be hurt. Euery action (as <hi>Galen</hi> obſerueth in many places) may be hurt three waies,<note place="margin">How many waies a functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be hurt.</note> for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is wholie loſt, or elſe greatly impayred, or elſe corrupted and depraued.

The ſight groweth weake,<note place="margin">How the ſight is weakened.</note> either through default of his faculties, or through the euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the inſtrument. The facultie which is that power of the ſoule, which maketh vs ſee, hath his ſeate in the braine: if then the brain be altered in his temperature, (as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it falleth out to be too hote, cold, moyſt or drie; or when it is not faſhioned well &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendablie) then all the ſences will bewray a great impeachment in their actions, but aboue all the reſt the ſight, becauſe the eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next neighbour vnto the braine, and of a merueilous ſimpathy with the ſame, will ſuffer firſt of all. The euill diſpoſition of the eye, weakeneth the ſight very oft, although that the facultie be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11348:33"/>and ſtrong. Such diſpoſition is found ſometimes in the whole eye, as when it is too fat and great, or too ſmall and leane, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ſome ſpeciall parts thereof, as in the tunicle, humors, muſcles, ſpirits, ſinewes, veines and arteries, vnto euery of which doe happen their particular diſeaſes, which I will runne through in the chapter following.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued and falſified.</note>The corrupting or falſifying of the ſight falleth out; when the obiect ſheweth it ſelfe to be of another colour, forme, quantitie or ſituation then it is; as for example, if a white thing ſhould ſhew yellow or red, becauſe the inſtrument of ſight is tainted with ſome colour: this it is which maketh them that haue the yellow Iaundiſe, to ſee euery thing yellow: when the thing which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth faſt, ſeemeth to moue, as it falleth out in them which haue the diſeaſe, called Vertigo, through the diſordered and extraordinarie mouing of the ſpirits; and when one ſingle thing ſeemeth two, and this falleth out, either through default of the inſtrument, or through the euill ſituation of the obiect, or of the eyebeames. If both the eyes be not in one and the ſame leuell, but that the one be high, and the other low, out of doubt euery thing which they behold will ſhew double: the cauſes hereof are oftentimes a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the one, and a conuulſion in the other. The nerue opticke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo being relaxed and mollified on the one ſide, cauſeth all things that are looked vpen to ſeeme double, as it happeneth to ſuch as are drunke. If you preſſe and beare downe the one eye with your finger, not touching the other, you ſhall ſee euery thing double<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which miſſight the ſituation of the inſtrument is the principall cauſe: and the ſituation of the obiect is the next. As if you whirle a ſtaffe round about, you would thinke that it were a circle, and if long wiſe, you would iudge it to be nothing but a long ſtretched line; which happeneth by the ſwift mouing of the obiect out of his place, for ſo, before the firſt figure be worne out, a ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into his place. The laſt cauſe conſiſteth in the diuerſe ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the eye beames; as if you looke yourſelfe in a crackt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſe, your face will ſeeme two faces vnto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The loſſe of the ſight.</note>The vtter loſſe and depriuation of the ſight, which we call blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, commeth either of the drineſſe of the humors, or of the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the two lights, that they cannot meete and ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

I will content my ſelfe to lay out the way and beſt ordered courſe thereunto, for the benefite of young Phiſitions and Chirurgeons, for whoſe ſake I haue made choice of this chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The diuiſion of the diſeaſes of the eye.</note>Now then as concerning the diſeaſes of the eye, ſome of them are common to the whole member, ſome others are proper vnto ſome particular part of the ſame. Thoſe which concerne the whole eye, are either ſimilar or inſtrumentall, or common. The ſimilar ones, are the moyſt, the drie, the hote, the colde diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,<note place="margin">The diſeaſes to be referred to the whole eye.</note> as alſo the ſimple, the compound, the diſtemperature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out matter, and that which is accompanied with matter. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall doe ſhew themſelues in the euill ſhape of the eye, as when it is ouer great or ouer little, or not ſo ſituate as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for comelines and vſe. The diſeaſes comming of the bignes of it, are when the eye is either too great or too little;<note place="margin">The greatnes of the eye.</note> the great eye is called the oxe eye, it hindereth the action of the eye, for the ſight is not ſo quicke, by reaſon of the exceſſiue expence of ſpirits, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſo readie in motion. The cauſe of this greatnes is either the error of the firſt forme and ſhape committed by nature, or elſe ſome accident whether flegmatike humor, or inflammation, or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11348:34"/>elſe ſome great fluxe of humours falling down vpon the ſame. The diſeaſe contrarie to this,<note place="margin">The ſmalnes of the eye.</note> is the ſmalnes of the eye, which either is the worke of nature, and is called the Pigges eye, or elſe happeneth by ſome other meanes, as by waſting of the naturall heate, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of intollerable paines, much watchings, ſharpe rhewmes, and continuall agues; in ſuch caſes the whole eye being weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it attracteth not his naturall nouriſhment, or though it doe, yet it cannot concoct it, and this diſeaſe is called the pining away, or leanenes of the eye.</p>

               <p>Loe theſe be the diſeaſes which may be referred to the whole bodie of the eye: for the diſeaſes called <hi>Nictalopia, Myopiaſis,</hi> and <hi>Amblyopia,</hi> are Symptomes, touching onely the ſpirits or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and not the whole eye.</p>

Now we haue alreadie obſerued for parts of the eye, the humors, coates, ſinews, and muſcles of the ſame: ſo then there are diſeaſes proper vnto euery one of theſe parts. I will begin to deſcribe thoſe which happen to the humours, as being the nobleſt parts of the eye, as alſo becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> in his booke of the cauſes of accidents hath taken the ſame courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The diſeaſe of the chriſtalline humour. Glaucoma.</note>The chriſtalline humour is ſubiect to all maner of diſeaſe, but the moſt vſuall is a drie diſtemperature, and his going out of his place. His drie diſtemperature is the cauſe of an accident, which the Grecians call <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which is a ſhrinking together, and drie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the chriſtalline humour, thereby becomming as it were white. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his third booke of Aphoriſmes obſerueth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11348:34"/>that this diſeaſe doth ſeldome happen but to olde folke, and wee iudge it incurable. The chriſtalline may ſhift out of his place ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies: for either it may ſhift to either ſide, or riſe higher, or fall lower, or it may ſhrinke further into the eye, or come forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the forepart of the eye.

If it be too much dried, as it falleth out very oft in cataracts, it taketh the ſight cleane away. If his ſtore be greatly diminiſhed, the chriſtalline humour drieth, the grape-like coate withereth, the hornie membrane ſhrinketh, and the outward light is not rebated. As concerning the glaſsie humour, writers haue not noted any diſeaſes properly belonging thereto: but, in my iudgement, it is ſubiect to the ſame affects that the wateriſh, both in his temperature, ſubſtance, and quantitie.</p>

As for the difference of colour, there are white, red, and yellowiſh ones. They differ in reſpect of their faſtning, becauſe ſome ſticke faſt and cloſe to, whereas others doe ſuffer themſelues to bee eaſily ſeparated. They differ in ſubſtance, becauſe ſome are thicke, and ſome thin, ſome ſoft, ſome hard, ſome membranous like skinnes, ſome fatty and like vnto greaſe, and ſome varicous, which are like vnto a net, knit and made of many ſmall veines and arteries. The bignes maketh the laſt difference: for ſome are ſo ſmall that they paſſe not the white: otherſome ſo great, as that they reach vnto the apple of the eye, and doe greatly hinder the ſight.</p>

The cauſe hereof is ordinarily outward; as ſome blow or fall: ſometimes it is inward, as the fulnes of the veines and the thinneſſe of the blood. There are ſome other diſeaſes of the white tunicle; as puſtules and white ſpots in maner of a skarre, but they are common with this vnto the hornie membrane.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of bread.</note>The bread muſt be made of cleane wheate, well leauened and ſome what ſalted, wherein may bee put Fennell or Aniſe-ſeede: it muſt not bee eaten new, nor after it is aboue three daies old. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread doth hurt the ſight extremely, eſpecially if there be any darnell therein: for ſome are of opinion that the vſe of darnell doth deſtroy the ſight. I haue ſometimes read in <hi>Plautus</hi> a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant treatiſe of a page, who not daring to call his companion blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard or blind-beetle, mocked him with hauing eaten of darnell.</p>

There are certaine ſorts of fleſh which haue a certaine ſpeciall propertie for to ſtrengthen and cleere the ſight, as the fleſh of the Pye, the Swallow, the Gooſe, of Vipers well prepared, of the Wolfe, of the he-gote, and other rauenous birds. The Arabian Phiſitions haue obſerued, that the eyes of liuing creatures, doe (I know not by what propertie or ſimpathie) comfort the ſight. They doe often vſe the fleſh of Swallowes and Pyes dried in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to pepper their meates withall. They forbid vs the vſe of groſſe fleſh, as of Porke, Hare and Hart.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of fiſh.</note>Fiſh (if we credit <hi>Auicen</hi>) is enemie vnto the eyes: but I thinke hee vnderſtandeth it of ſuch as liue in ſtanding waters, which

               <p>As concerning ſalt meates, ſpices and fauces, all of them are not forbidden: wee vſe to make artificiall ſalts, which ſerue marueilouſlie to cleere the ſight: and therewithall muſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily meates bee ſalted.<note place="margin">Of artificiall ſalts.</note> The ſalt of treacle is moſt excellent, whereto may be added ſome Nutmeg, Mace, Cloues and Fennell ſeede.

The Arabians, which were more addicted to diſhmeate then the Greekes, doe commend Turneps: but with all theſe it is very certaine that wee muſt mixe Fennell or Aniſeede, becauſe they be very windie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Drinke. What quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is to be vſed.

To graunt the ſame which they affirme, I holde it needfull to alay the wine well with water, and to make choiſe of ſome ſmall wine, ſo that it be not ſharpe or vaporouſe: ſweete and new wines are very fuming, thicke wines ſtay too long in the ſtomacke, and ſend too great a quantitie of vapours vnto the braine. We vſe to make an artificiall wine of Eyebright,<note place="margin">Artificiall wines.</note> which is very ſingular for the preſeruation of the ſight. <hi>Arnaldus de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanoua,</hi> a famous Phiſition doth confidently affirme, that he cured an olde man almoſt quite blinde, by the onely vſe of wine of eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright. Alſo it will doe well to caſt a bunch of Eyebright in the wine which one drinketh ordinarilie, or otherwiſe, as I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſaid, ſome Burnet with the flowers of Borage; for beſides that they comfort the ſight with their colour, they will helpe to purge the ſpirits, and to repreſſe vapours. The hearbes are common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and to be come by at all ſeaſons. Such as will not vſe wine,<note place="margin">Hydromell.</note> ſhal drinke a ſimple honied water, or elſe compound one in maner as followeth. Take of ceſterne or fountaine water fifteene pounds, of good honie one pound, mingle them both together in a pot, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto ſome Fennell, Eyebright, and Mace, made vp in a little bagge, the waight of a French crowne, boyle all together, vnto the conſumption of the third part, euermore looking well to the taking off of the ſcum of the honey.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of watching and ſleeping.</note>In watching and ſleeping, it behoueth to keepe a meane: to ſleepe very long hurteth the ſight, and to ſleepe at noones maketh ablowne paire of cheekes, troubleth the ſight, and maketh all the

I finde the remedie which I now ſet downe,<note place="margin">A very good medicine for the eyes.</note> to be very good for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and ſtrength of the eyes. Take of the water of Eyebright and Roſes well diſtilled, foure ounces: afterward prouide two or three ſmall bags in which is contained a dram and a halfe of Tutia well prepared, and of good Aloes a ſcruple: hang theſe bagges in the waters aforeſaid, and waſh your eyes therewith euery night.</p>

An anſwere in trueth beſeeming a great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, rather then a rude and vnlettered man. For man hauing the image of God engrauen in his ſoule,<note place="margin">The praiſe of mankinde.</note> and repreſenting in his body the modell of the whole world, can in a moment transforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into euery thing like a Proteus, or receiue at an inſtant the ſtampe of a thouſand colours like to the Chamelion. <hi>Phauorine</hi> acknowledged nothing to be great here on earth but onely man. The wiſe men of Egypt haue vouchſafed him ſuch honour, as to call him a mortall God. Thrice renowmed <hi>Mercurie</hi> calleth him the liuing creature full of diuine parts, the meſſenger of the Gods, the Lord of the things below, and fellow companion with the Spirits aboue: <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> the meaſure of all things: <hi>Syneſius,</hi> the Horizon of things hauing and not hauing bodies: <hi>Zoroaster</hi> in a certaine kinde of rauiſhment proclamed him, the mightie worke
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11348:45"/>and wonder of nature: <hi>Plato,</hi> the marueile of marueiles: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the politike liuing creature, furniſhed with reaſon and counſaile, which is all, as poſſeſsing all things by power, though not really and in very deede (as <hi>Empedocles</hi> would haue it to be) but by the comprehending and conceiuing of the formes and ſeuerall ſorts of things: <hi>Plinie</hi> the ape or puppie of nature, the counterfeit of the whole world, the abridgement of the great world. Amongſt the Diuines, there are ſome which haue called him, euery maner of creature, becauſe he hath intercourſe with euery maner of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; he hath a being, as haue the ſtones; life, as haue the plants; and ſence or feeling as the beaſts; and vnderſtanding, as haue the Angels. Otherſome haue honoured him, giuing him the title of vniuerſall gouernour, as hauing all things vnder his empire and iuriſdiction, as being he to whom euery thing yeeldeth obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and for whoſe ſake the whole world was created. In briefe, this is the chiefe and principall of Gods worke, and the moſt noble of all other creatures. But this his excellencie,<note place="margin">From whence the excellencie of man ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth.</note> whereby he is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then all the reſt, is not in reſpect of his bodie, although the ſhape thereof bee more exquiſite, better tempered, and of more comely proportion then any other thing in the world, ſeruing as <hi>Polycletus</hi> his rule for the faſhioning of other things, and being as a platforme, whereby the maſter builders may frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue their buildings. This noblenes (I ſay) commeth not of the bodie, which conſiſteth of matter and is corruptible: no, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract thereof, or that which is indeede excellent therein, is further fetcht: It is the ſoule alone whereby he is ſo renowmed,<note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</note> being a forme altogether celeſtiall and diuine, not taking his originall from the effectuall working of any matter, as that of plants and beaſts doth.

For beſides the vegetatiue and ſenſitiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, it inioyeth three ſpeciall powers and faculties, which extol and aduance man, aboue all other liuing creatures: and theſe three are the Imagination, Reaſon, and Memorie.

For as the moſt prudent and carefull Captaines vndertake very oft the enterpriſes which proue fooliſh and fond, and that becauſe of falſe aduertiſement: euen ſo reaſon doth often make but fooliſh diſcourſes, hauing been miſſe-informed by a fayned fantaſie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The opinions of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt the excellencie of imagination.</note>Some Greeke Philoſophers there be, which would debarre the imagination of her reputed renowne and excellencie, ſtraining themſelues to make her as baſe as the other actions of the ſences: and I haue in place where, read two ſeuerall opinions to that end: the firſt is of ſuch as thinke that the imagination and common ſence is all one: the other is of them, which affirme that brute beaſts haue an imagination as well as men; and that either of theſe two being true, there is not any cauſe why it ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronized among the worthies.<note place="margin">The error of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</note> But I will cauſe it to appeare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vnto euery one, how fondly they haue ſuffered themſelues to be abuſed.</p>
               <p>All ſuch as haue applied themſelues to play the Philoſophers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the moſt commendable ſort and maner, doe holde it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and out of all queſtion: that the imagination is a certaine thing ſurpaſſing the common or inward ſence, which iudgeth of all outward obiects, and vnto which as vnto their center, all the formes of the other ſences doe betake themſelues: for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, receiueth at one and the ſame inſtant with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſences the formes of things;<note place="margin">The difference betwixt the imagination and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence.</note> and that (if I may be allowed to vſe ſchoole tearmes) with the reall power of the obiect, but the imagination receiueth and reteyneth them without any preſence of the obiect. The imagination compoundeth and ioyneth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the formes of things, as of Golde and a mountaine, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a golden mountaine, which the common ſence cannot doe:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11348:46"/>for the inward ſence cannot take holde of any thing, ſaue that which the outward ſences perceiue, but the imagination procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further: for the ſillie Sheepe hauing ſpied the Wolfe, getteth himſelfe by and by out of his way, as from his enemie; this eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie is not knowne by the ſence, for it is no obiect of the ſences, but it is the meere worke of imagination to know the ſame. This then is a power farre differing from the common ſence, which in deede is found truely to be in beaſts, but the other cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie be found in them in that degree of excellencie that it is in men. I would that euery one ſhould ſee the difference betwixt that imagination which is in men, and that which is in beaſts. The imagination which is in beaſts,<note place="margin">The difference betwixt the imagination of men, and that of beaſts.</note> ſerueth them onely to follow the motions and paſſions of their appetite, and is not imployed, but onely about action, that is to ſay, either in following that which may doe them good, or in auoiding of that which may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy them. The imagination of man ſerueth both for action and contemplation.<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> The imagination of beaſts cannot counterfeite any thing further, then as it is preſent and before their eyes;<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> but man hath the libertie to imagine what he liſteth, and although there be no preſent obiect, yet it taketh out of the treaſurie, which is the memorie whatſoeuer may content it. The beaſts haue their imagination occupied onely when they are exerciſed,<note place="margin">The third.</note> and not when they are out of worke and labour; but man hath the vſe of imagination at all times, and at euery houre. The beaſt hath no ſooner imagined, but he moueth himſelfe by and by,<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> and goeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which his appetite ſtirreth him vp vnto; but man follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not alwaies the motions of his appetite, he hath reaſon to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the ſame with all, as when it findeth out any error therein. The imagination of beaſts cannot frame to it ſelfe any mountaines of golde, neither yet can it faine the things that are darke and ſubtile,<note place="margin">The fift.</note> or flying aſſes, as the imagination of man can. Finally,<note place="margin">The ſixt.</note> the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of man ſeemeth to enter into ſome maner of diſcourſe with the vnderſtanding. For hauing beheld a painted Lyon, it perceiueth that it is not a thing to be feared, and at the ſame time, ioyning it ſelfe vnto reaſon, doth confirme and make bolde. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde now, how the imagination of man doth magnifie it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue that of beaſts, and for what cauſe I haue ſet it in ranke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amongſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:11348:47"/>the excellenteſt and nobleſt powers of the minde. The Arabians haue ſo highly commended it,<note place="margin">The effects of imagination.</note> that they haue verely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, that the minde by vertue of the imagination could worke miracles, pearce the heauens, commaunde the elements, lay plaine the huge mountaines, and make mountaines of the plaine ground: and to be ſhort, that vnto the iuriſdiction thereof were ſubiect, all maner of materiall formes, and they called all the three powers of the minde, moſt excellent and renowmed minds, and therefore that which is called imagination, is the firſt facultie or power of the minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the ſecond power of the minde.</note>The vnderſtanding followeth next in order, and awaketh at the knocke of imagination, it maketh things ſenſible, vniuerſall, diſcourſeth, gathereth concluſions, reaſoneth from the effects to the cauſes, and from the beginnings, euen to the middeſt, and ſo to the ends and iſſues of things.<note place="margin">Of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, called paſſible or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</note> The Philoſophers diſtinguiſh this vnderſtanding power, into a ſuffering and doing power: the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, is that which receiueth the formes of things, pure and free from all matter, and is as it were the ſubiect of all maner of formes:<note place="margin">Of actiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</note> the doing power is as it were a light, which maketh cleere and perfect the ſuffering: in ſuch maner, as that the one doth as it were ſerue in ſtead of the matter, and the other of the forme, and both ioyned togetgher,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> doe perfite and make vp reaſon the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and predominant power of the minde, proper vnto man, which can doe much without the bodie, and vnto which the bodie very oft is a let and hindrance, being that alone which is without matter, being alſo not ſubiect to paſſions, immortall, differing from the ſences,<note place="margin">How reaſon differeth from the ſences.</note> and all other corporall actions, becauſe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are loſt by the violence of ſome great obiect, as the hearing, by a ſtrong and forcible ſound; the taſte, by taſting ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame fauour; the ſight by an exceſſiue whitenes; witnes hereof is the Sicilian tyrant, who by cunning practiſe put out the eyes of all his priſoners: but the vnderſtanding, the more excellent and ſurpaſſing that the obiect is, the more it ſheweth forth his owne perfection and noblenes, the contemplation of high and diuine things doth rauiſh it, yea herein it findeth greateſt contentation, herein it placeth his chiefeſt felicitie. This is that onely power which groweth more and more, when the bodie declineth, which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:11348:47"/>then is in his chiefeſt ſtrength, when the bodie groweth faint and feeble: which becommeth ſtrong and luſtie, when all the ſences grow weake and feeble, which whirleth through the ayre, and walketh ouer the wide world, when the bodie is immoueable, which cauſeth vs when we are in ſleepe, oftentimes to ſee ſome glaunces of his diuine nature, in foretelling things to come, and, if it bee not ouerwhelmed with the Sea of vapours, riſing of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue cramming in of bellie cheere, it lifteth it ſelfe aboue the world, and euen aboue his owne nature, and beholdeth the glorie of the Angels and myſteries of heauen. Finally, reaſon hauing thus ſwiftlie conueyed her ſelfe to take the view of whatſoeuer is, and hauing diſcourſed and conceiued a million of goodly and pleaſant formes, being vnable any longer to retaine them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them to the cuſtodie of memorie, which is her faithfull ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie, and wherein,<note place="margin">Memorie.</note> as in a place of greateſt truſtines to keepe the ſame, the moſt precious treaſures of the ſoule are placed. This is that rich treaſurie, which incloſeth within one only inner roome all the ſciences, and what elſe ſoeuer hath paſſed ſince the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, which lodgeth euery thing in his ſeuerall place, not ſhufling them vp diſorderly together, which obſerueth time, circumſtances and order, and which is (as <hi>Plato</hi> tearmeth it) a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne to containe the running ſtreames of the vnderſtanding: this facultie is called remembrance, and is proper vnto man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: for beaſtes haue likewiſe a certaine kinde of memorie, but they cannot call to minde the time, order and circumſtances, this cannot be accompliſhed without a Syllogiſme. See here the mind of man attended by theſe three famous faculties, the imagination, reaſon, and memorie, all which three are lodged in one ſelfeſame palace, and within this round towre, which we call the head:<note place="margin">The diuerſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſeates of theſe powers.</note> but whether this fall out to be in all the braine equally, and alike, or that euery one of them ſhould haue his ſeuerall chamber, it is not fully reſolued vpon. I know very well that there is a great quarell betwixt the Greeke and Arabian Phiſitions,<note place="margin">The Grecians would haue them diffuſed through the ſubſtance of the whole braine.</note> about the lodgings of theſe three princeſſes, &amp; that no man hitherto hath bin able to reconcile them. The Greekes would lodge them in euerie part of the braine; the Arabians quarter out euery of them by it ſelfe. The Greekes maintaine that in all places where the reaſon is, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:11348:48"/>there the imagination and memorie doe accompanie it, and that al the three are as much before as behind: finally, that they be al of them in all and euery part of the braine. They alleage for one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reaſon on their ſide, that euery ſimilar action is wholie and intirely in euery part of his ſubiect, as for example, nouriſhment is equallie and alike in all the bone, and whatſoeuer part of the bone it be, there is to be found continuallie theſe foure faculties, that is, the attractiue, retentiue, digeſtiue and expulſiue. On the contrary the Arabians will haue,<note place="margin">The contrarie opinion of the Arabians.</note> that euery one of theſe faculties enioy his proper ſeate: and they haue very goodly reaſons for that which they holde.<note place="margin">The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Firſt, it is very certaine, that there are diuerſe pettie chambers in the braine, which the Anatomiſts call Ventricles, theſe chambers are not for nothing, yea and there is no man that can thinke, that they were made for any other vſe, then to be lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings for theſe three faculties: and that, as though the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be lodged in the two firſt, Reaſon in the middlemoſt, and Memorie in the hindermoſt: and the appearance of the truth of this thing is very great: for the imagination receiueth all the obiects of the ſences, and therefore ought to be placed very neere vnto the ſences: but ſo the caſe ſtandeth, as that all the ſences are in the forepart of the head: the imagination preſenteth all theſe obiects vnto the reaſon, which maketh them voide of matter and vniuerſall, ſo that of neceſſitie it muſt follow as ſecond. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hauing after ſome time ſerued and ſatisfied it ſelfe of theſe pleaſant formes, committeth them to the cuſtodie of memorie: whereupon it followeth of neceſſitie, that it ſhould be placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and as it were in her inner chamber.<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> Furthermore, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being effected by receiuing in of formes, muſt haue his ſeat in the ſofteſt part of the braine, becauſe the prints of pictures are moſt eaſilie ſet in a ſoft bodie: Memorie which keepeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth the formes, craueth a more hard part, for elſe the picture would be defaced by and by after that it ſhould be printed: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the greateſt of renowne ought to be placed in ſuch a part of the braine, as is moſt temperate. But there is no doubt, but the forepart of the braine is the ſofteſt, and the hinder part the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and the middlemoſt the moſt temperate: ſo then we muſt beleeue that imagination is before, and memorie behinde.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:11348:48"/>
               <p> Philoſophers that haue written of Phiſiognomie,<note place="margin">The third.</note> ſay that ſuch as haue the hinder part of the head hanging out much, haue a good memorie; that ſuch as haue large and high foreheads, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall as it were boſſed, are of pleaſant imagination: and that ſuch as in whom theſe two eminences are wanting, are blockiſh, without imagination, and without memorie.<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> If we will (ſaith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> in his Problemes) enter into any ſerious and deepe conceit, we knit the browes and draw them vp: if we would call to mind and remember anything, wee hang downe the head, and rub the hinder part, which ſheweth very well that the imagination lieth before, and the memorie behinde.

The fourth ventricle is ſomewhat ſharpe poynted, to the end that formes may be the better vnited, and that the reflexe thereof may the more fully caſt it ſelfe vpon the third, wherein reaſon lodgeth: the two firſt are the wideſt, for that they receiue the firſt obiects which are not as yet refined: that in the middeſt was fitteſt for reaſon, becauſe it might receiue the images or formes of the two firſt, and hauing forgotten them, might ſeeke them out; as it were in her moſt cloſe and ſecret place of cuſtodie, contriued for that end behinde. Finally,<note place="margin">The ſeuenth.</note> that which hath made the Arabians to ſtand ſo ſtiffelie in their opinion, and to maintaine that theſe three faculties, haue euery one their ſeuerall lodging, is becauſe they haue oftentimes obſerued, that one of theſe three may be hurt, and not the other; the imagination is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oft corrupted, the reaſon ſtanding ſound and intier: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariewiſe, how many franticke and melancholike men be there, which diſcourſe very excellently, notwithſtanding their fooliſh and vaine imaginations. <hi>Galen</hi> writeth two hiſtories of two franticke men, the one of which had his imagination trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and his reaſon ſound, the other his reaſon troubled, and his imagination ſounde. Wee ſee an infinite number which haue vtterly loſt their memorie, and yet faile not to diſcourſe very well. <hi>Thucidides</hi> mencioneth, that in that great plague which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:11348:49"/>diſpeopled almoſt al Greece, there were moe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a million, which forgot euery thing euen to their owne name, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did not thereupon become fooles. <hi>Meſſala Coruinus</hi> in his recouerie of a certaine ſicknes, did not remember his own name. <hi>Trapezontius</hi> was very wiſe whileſt he was young, but drawing neere vnto old age he quite forgot all. Seeing therefore that one of theſe faculties may be hurt without the other, we muſt beleeue that euery of them hath his particular place.<note place="margin">The concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> If it were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me to giue iudgement in this controuerſie, I ſhould ſay that the Greekes had plaide the more ſubtile Philoſophers, and that their opinion is the more true: but that that of the Arabians will euer be more followed of the common people, for that it hath in it a greater ſhew of euident cleerenes. I will not draw on this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to any greater length: it is enough for me to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the minde hath three moſt excellent faculties, al which lodge within the braine, and cauſe man to appeare more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, then any other creature, which inable him alſo to gouerne all the world, and which giue him the title of a ſociable and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike liuing creature.</p>

We muſt therefore for the orderly handling of this matter, ſet downe all the ſorts and differences of melancholike perſons, to the end that the likenes of names may not trouble vs in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele of this diſcourſe.<note place="margin">That there are foure humors in our bodies.</note> It is a thing moſt freely agreed vpon in Phiſicke, that there are foure humours in our bodies, Blood, Phlegme, Choler, and Melancholie; and that all theſe are to bee found at all times, in euery age, and at all ſeaſons to be mixed and mingled together within the veines, though not alike much of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one: for euen as it is not poſſible to finde the partie in whom the foure elements are equally mixed; and as there is not that temperament in the world, in which the foure contrary qualities are in the whole &amp; euery part equally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded, but that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie there muſt be ſome one euermore which doth exceed the other: euen ſo it is not poſſible to ſee any perfect liuing creature, in which the foure humours are equally mixed, there is alwaies ſome one which doth ouer-rule the reſt, and of it is the parties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; named: if blood doe abound, we call ſuch a complexion; ſanguine; if phlegme, phlegmatike; if choler, cholerike; and if melancholie, melancholike. Theſe foure humours, if they doe not too much abound, may very eaſily ſtand with the health of the partie: for they doe not ſenſibly hurt and hinder the actions of the bodie. It is moſt true that euery conſtitutions bringeth forth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:11348:51"/>his different effects, which make the actions of the ſoule more quicke and liuely, or more dull and dead.

But <hi>Heraclitus</hi> oftentimes ſaid, that a drie light did make the wifeſt minde: there are but ſmall ſtore of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their braine, their ſpirits are moſt pure, and are not eaſilie waſted, they are hardly drawne from their purpoſe and meaning; their conceit is very deepe, their memorie very faſt, their bodie ſtrong to endure labour, and when this humour groweth hot, by the vapours of blood, it cauſeth as it were, as kinde of diuine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhment, commonly called <hi>Enthouſiaſma,</hi> which ſtirreth men vp to plaie the Philoſophers, Poets, and alſo to propheſie: in ſuch maner, as that it may ſeeme to containe in it ſome diuine parts.

The other ſort of dotage is without a feauer, and it is either accompanied with rage and furie, and then it is called <hi>Mania,</hi> or madnes: or elſe with feare and ſadnes, and then it is caled melancholie. Melancholie therefore is a dotage,<note place="margin">What dotage is.</note> not coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with an ague, but with feare and ſadnes. We call that dotage, when ſome one of the principall faculties of the minde, as imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or reaſon is corrupted. All melancholike perſons haue their imagination troubled, for that they deuiſe with themſelues a thouſand fantaſticall inuentions and obiects, which in deede are not at all: they haue alſo verie oft their reaſon corrupted.<note place="margin">Why melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie is not accompanied with a feuer.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot make any doubt, whether melancholie be a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or no, but it is ordinarylie without a feuer, becauſe the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is drie, and hath theſe two qualities, coldenes, and drynes, which are altogether contrarie vnto putrefaction, ſo that there cannot any putriſied vapour breath out of them, (no more then there doth out of meere aſhes) which might be conueyed to the heart, there to kindle the fire and procure a feauer. Feare and ſadnes are vnſeperable companions of this miſerable griefe, for ſome reaſons which I will ſet downe in the chapter following. Beholde here the deſcription of melancholie, as it is a ſymptome or accident, which hath relation to ſome action, hurt and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that is to ſay, to the imagination and reaſon depraued and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.

I take it that the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of melancholie is made cleere and plaine enough, by this little diſcourſe: Now let vs come to the differences and diuers ſorts thereof.<note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie.</note> There are three kindes of melancholie: the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the onely and ſole fault of the braine, the other ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticallie proceedeth from the whole bodie, when as the whole temperature and conſtitution of the bodie is melancholike; the third ariſeth from amongſt the bowels, but eſpecially from the ſpleene liuer and the membrance called meſenterium. The firſt is called ſimplie and abſolutelie by the name of melancholie, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is called the windie melancholie with an addition. The firſt is the moſt tedious of all the reſt, it vexeth the patient continuallie, affoording little or no breathing whiles vnto him: that which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:11348:53"/>riſeth from amongſt the bowels, doth handle the grieued nothing ſo roughlie, it hath his periods, oftentimes making truce with the diſeaſed. The firſt hath many degrees of afflicting: if it haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it extraordinarie, it ſhall not alter his name, but and if it fall out to affect the partie altogether with ſauage conditions, it ſhall be called Wolues melancholie; if with raging and violent paſſion of loue, Knights melancholie. The flatuous or windie melancholie hath alſo his degrees, for there is ſome ſorts of it but eaſie and light, and there are other ſome that are very fierce and violent. And now intending to handle all theſe ſorts in order, I will begin with that which hath his ſeate in the braine.</p>

Here we haue ample occaſion adminiſtred to enter into ſome Philoſophicall diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and for pleaſure ſake, I minde to recreate my ſelfe in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all the cauſes of theſe accidents, beginning with that of feare. The greateſt Phiſitions are at controuerſie, from whence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11348:54"/>this feare in melancholike perſons ſhould come.<note place="margin">Why melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike men are alwaies afraide. Galen his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> imputeth all vnto the colour which is blacke, and thinketh that the ſpirits being made wilde, and the ſubſtance of the braine, as it were clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and darke, all the obiects thereof appeare terrible, and that the minde is in continuall darkenes. And euen as wee ſee the night doth bring with it ſome maner of feare, not onely to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but ſometimes alſo to the moſt confident:<note place="margin">Auerrhoes mocketh Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</note> euen ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike perſons hauing in their braine a continuall night, are in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant feare. <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> that had deeper inſight in Philoſophie, then ſame for his skill in Phiſicke, and being the ſworne enemie of <hi>Galen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The colour of the humour is not the cauſe of feare. The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> laugheth to ſcorne this reaſon. The colour (ſaith he) cannot be the cauſe of this feare, becauſe colours can alter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the eyes, being onely the obiect of the ſight, ſo that the minde can ſee nothing without the eyes. But there is neuer an eye in the braine; how then can it finde it ſelfe agrieued at the blacknes of the melancholike humour, ſeeing that it cannot ſee it?<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> I adde for the more confirmation of <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> his argument, that the blacknes of the colour is ſo farre from being any cauſe of this feare in melancholike perſons, as that it is rather that colour which they moſt loue, as being enemies to Sun and light, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing darkenes altogether, ſeeking after ſhadowed places, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king often in the night, and that with greater boldnes then vpon the day.<note place="margin">The third.</note> Furthermore, madnes is cauſed of an humour, as blacke as that which cauſeth melancholie, for the humour called blacke choler is altogether blacke and gliſtning like pitch, and therefore can make blacke the ſpirits and braine, as well as the other. But we ſee it falleth out, that mad men are nothing fearefull, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bolde and furious, not taking acknowledgement of any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as appeareth in their headlong caſting of themſelues into the deuouring fire,<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> and vpon the murtherous knife. Finally, if blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhould be the cauſe of ſuch feare, it ſhould follow on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, that whitenes ſhould make them bolde; but how is it then, that ſuch as abound with Phlegme are alſo commonly fearefull? the colour therefore cannot be the cauſe of this feare. But ſaith <hi>Auerrhoes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auerrhoes his opinion.</note> it muſt needes be, that the cauſe hereof is the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the melancholike humour which is colde, and worketh ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects contrarie vnto thoſe of heate. Heate maketh men bolde,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11348:54"/>quicke of motion, and headlong in all their actions: colde on the contrarie maketh them fearefull, leaden-heelde, and not reſoluing of any thing. All ſuch as are of a colde temperament, become fearefull: olde folkes ordinarilie are fearefull, and ſo are gelded men alſo: women are alwaies more timerous then men, and to be briefe, the qualities of the minde doe follow the temperament of the bodie.<note place="margin">The authors iudgement.</note> Loe here here the contrarie opinions of theſe two great and famous men: I thinke they may be reconciled, if wee would ioyne theſe two cauſes together, that is the temperature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as the chiefe and principall, and the blacke colour of the Spirits, as that which may much further and helpe forward the ſame. The melancholike humour being colde, doth not onely coole the braine, but alſo the heart, (being the feare of this coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious facultie of the Soule, which men call the inſtinct and prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of nature vnto anger) and rebateth the flames therein; hence creepeth out feare: the ſame humour being blacke, cauſeth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall ſpirits, which ought to be pure, ſubtile, cleere and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, it maketh them I ſay groſſe, darke, and as it were all to be ſmoked. But the ſpirits being the chiefe and principall inſtrument of the minde, if they be blacke and ouercooled alſo, doe trouble her moſt noble powers, and principally the imagination, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto it continually blacke formes and ſtrange viſions, which may be ſeene with the eye, notwithſtanding that they be within. This is a deepe reach, which no man hitherto (it may be) hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, and it ſerueth infinitely for the defence of <hi>Galen:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That with our owne eyes, we may ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within the ſame.</note> The eye doth not onely ſee that which is without, but it ſeeth alſo that which is within, howſoeuer it may iudge that ſame thing to be without. Thoſe which haue ſome ſmall beginnings of a Cataract, doe ſee many bodies flying, like to Ants, flyes, and long haires, the ſame alſo doe ſuch as are readie to vomite. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> place amongſt the ſignes adn tokens of a criticall fluxe of blood, theſe falſe apparitions, as when one ſeeth red bodies han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the ayre, which yet notwithſtanding are not there, becauſe that then euery one ſhould ſee them: this is an inward vapour which offereth it ſelfe vnto the chriſtalline humour in his naturall colour, and ſo if it ariſe of blood, it appeareth red: if of choler, yellow: and wherefore then ſhould not the vapours of the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:11348:55"/>humour, and of the ſpirits being blacke, ordinarilie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelues, and appeare in their naturall colour vnto the eye, and ſo vnto the imagination? The melancholike partie may ſee that which is within his owne braine, but vnder another forme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the ſpirits and blacke vapours continually paſſe by the finewes, vaines and arteries, from the braine vnto the eye, which cauſeth it to ſee many ſhadowes and vntrue apparitions in the aire, whereupon from the eye the formes thereof are conueyed vnto the imagination, which being continuallie ſerued with the ſame diſh, abideth continuallie in feare and terror. That which maketh me to ioyne the blacke colour with the temperature, is, becauſe the braine is very oft of colde diſtemperature, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we finde not the partie troubled, either with ſuch feare, nor yet ſuch gaſtlie ſights. Fleagme is yet more colde then melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, and notwithſtanding it troubleth not the imagination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his whitenes hath ſome reſemblance of the ſubſtance of the braine,<note place="margin">That the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> and with the colour and cleerenes of the ſpirits: but the melancholike humour is altogether oppoſite and enemie vnto the ſame. Our ſpirits account colde and darkenes to be their enemies, feeling the colde, they drawn themſelues in, and as darkenes preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on more and more, ſo they flie blacke into their fort and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, forſake the vtter parts, and procure vs to ſleepe: the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike humour hath both theſe properties, it is colde and darke, it ought not therefore to aſtoniſh vs, if that we ſee it to moleſt the moſt noble and principall powers of the minde: ſeeing it tainteth and brandeth with blackenes the principall inſtrument thereof, which is the ſpirit, which paſſing from the braine to the eye, and from the eye to the braine backe againe, is able to moue theſe blacke ſights, and to ſet them vnceſſantly before the minde. Loe heere the firſt accident which haunteth melancholike perſons: they are alwaies full of feare, for they feare euery thing, euen that which is furtheſt off from feare: they are hartleſſe, they honour their enemies, and abuſe their friends, they conceiue of death, as a terrible thing, and notwithſtanding (which is ſtrange) they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſire it, yea ſo eagerlie, as that they will not let to deſtroy themſelues: but this falleth out then only when feare is turned into diſpayre, it is true in deede, that this happeneth ſo oft vnto thoſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:11348:55"/>whom melancholie ſimply aſſaileth, as vnto thoſe which are mad.<note place="margin">Mad men doe more oft kill themſelues, then melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpons.</note> Wee haue very few examples of meere melancholike perſons which haue ſlaine themſelues, but of mad men very many are found, and thoſe of great reputation. <hi>Empedocles Agrigentinus</hi> became mad, and caſt himſelfe headlong into the burning flames of the mountaine Aetna.<note place="margin">Examples.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariax</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Telamon</hi> was out of his wits, for that he was not thought worthie of <hi>Achilles</hi> armour; but that it was adiudged vnto <hi>Vliſſes.</hi> Whereupon he paſſed ouer ſome part of his furie in killing all maner of cattell he met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, thinking he had ſlaine <hi>Vliſſes</hi> and all his companions. <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> being likewiſe out of his wits, ſlew himſelf with his own ſword. <hi>Orestes</hi> hauing ſlaine his mother <hi>Clytemneſtra,</hi> was ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly outraged, that if his deare friend <hi>Pylades</hi> had not carefully watched ouer him, he had deſtroyed himſelfe a hundred times. It falleth out therefore more oft vnto mad, then to melancholike men to kill themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſad.</note>The ſecond accident which almoſt neuer leaueth melancholike perſons, is ſadnes: they weepe and know not wherefore: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the diſtemperature of the humour is the cauſe thereof: for as ioy and cheerefulnes proceede from heate and moyſture well tempered, ſo heauines and ſadnes come from the two contrarie qualities which are found in this humour. For the moſt part of men of ſanguine complexion are cheerefull and merrie, becauſe they conſiſt of a mixture of moyſture and heate: cholerike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are way ward and vnpleaſant, becauſe their heate is drie, and hath as it were an edge ſet vpon it: melancholike perſons are ſad and peruerſe, becauſe they bee cold and drie. Euen ſo it befell the ſillie <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> who (as he is very artificially ſet out in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>) went wandring through the defart places continually mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and lamenting. And the Epheſian Philoſopher named <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus,</hi> liued in continuall teares, becauſe (ſayth <hi>Theophrastus</hi>) that he was poſſeſſed of melancholie; and as his writings altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confuſed; and darkned with obſcuritie doe ſufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why they be ſuſpicious.</note>The accident of ſuſpition followeth the two former hard and cloſe at the heeles: the melancholike party is euermore ſuſpicious, if he ſee three or foure talking together, he thinketh that it is of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:11348:56"/>him. The cauſe of ſuch ſuſpition riſeth of the former feare, and of a corrupt kinde of reaſoning: for being alwaies in feare, he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth verely that one or other doeth lie in wait for him, and that ſome doe purpoſe to ſlay him. Melancholike men (ſayth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) doe deceiue themſelues commonly in matters which depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on choice, for that they oftentimes forget the generall propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherein honeſtie conſiſteth, and chuſe rather to follow the motions of their fooliſh imaginations.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The cauſe of their reſtleſnes.</note>They are neuer at reſt either in their bodies or in their ſpirits, they can make no anſwere to ſuch queſtions as are propounded them, they oftentimes change from one kinde to another. This diſquieting and diſtracting of themſelues, ariſeth of the diuerſitie of matters which they propound and ſet before themſelues, for receiuing all maner of formes, and ſtamping them with the print of diſlike; they are conſtrained oftentimes to change, and to find out new things, which being no more acceptable to them then the firſt, doe ſtill continue them in theſe reſtles diſtractions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The cauſe of their ſighing.</note>Melancholike folke are commonly giuen to ſigh, becauſe the minde being poſſeſſed with great varietie and ſtore of fooliſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, doth not remember or ſuffer the partie to bee at leiſure to breathe according to the neceſſitie of nature, whereupon ſhe is conſtrained at once to ſup vp as much ayre, as otherwiſe would ſerue for two or three times; and this great draught of breath is called by the name of ſighing, which is as it were a reduplicating of the ordinary manner of breathing. In this order it falleth out with louers, and all thoſe which are very buſily occupied in ſome deepe contemplation. Sillie fooles likewiſe which fall into a wonder at the ſight of any beautifull and goodly picture, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to giue a great ſight, their will (which is the efficient cauſe of breathing) being altogether diſtracted, and wholly poſſeſſed with the ſight of the image.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why they watch and can not ſleepe.</note>There is yet another accident which is very tedious, and euen conſumeth theſe poore melancholike men, euen continuall watchings. I haue ſeene ſome that haue abode three whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths without ſleepe.<note place="margin">The cauſes of ſleepe.</note> Now the cauſes of ſuch watchings are eaſie enough to vnderſtand, if wee know what it is which cauſeth vs to ſleepe. Men are giuen to obſerue in ſleepe the materiall, formall,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:11348:56"/>finall and inſtrumentall cauſe. The materiall is a pleaſant vapour, which is caſt vp from the firſt and ſecond concoction, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it commeth to ſlacken and ſtop all the ſinewes by his moyſture, it cauſeth all ſence and motion for to ceaſe. The finall cauſe is the repayre of ſpirits, and the reſt of all the animall powers which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing been wearied by continuall labour, doe craue a little reliefe and recreation: this end cannot be obtained, if ſo bee the minde which ſetteth all the powers of the bodie on worke, be not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed ſome maner of peaceable reſt: in this ſort the ſillie <hi>Dido</hi> all ouer whelmed with muſing penſiuenes, could not eſpie the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of night to the ſhutting vp of her mournfull eyes, or eaſing of her oppreſſed heart. The formall cauſe of ſleepe conſiſteth in the withdrawing of the ſpirits and naturall heate, from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, to the inward, and from all the circumference vnto the center. The inſtrumentall cauſe is the braine, which muſt be of good temperature: for if it be too hot, as in frenticke folkes; or drie, as in old folkes, the ſleepe will neuer be with peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The cauſes of all that watchfulnes which is in melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perſons.</note>In melancholike perſons the materiall is wanting, the minde is not at reſt, the braine is diſtempered, the matter is a melancholike humour, drie as aſhes, from whence cannot ariſe any pleaſant and delightſome vapour, the braine is diſtempered, and greatly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dried, the minde is in continuall reſtleſnes: for the feare that is in them doth continually ſet before them tedious &amp; grieuous things, which ſo gnaw and pinch them, as that they hinder them from ſleeping.

All the conditions of men and all their properties are not like. One man feedeth himſelfe with couetouſnes, and another with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this ſillie man is led captiue of loue, and religious deuotion preuaileth with another. This humour then will imprint in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike men the obiects moſt anſwerable to their condition of life and ordinarie actions. If an ambitious man become melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike, he ſtraight way dreameth that he is a King, an Emperour, a Monarke. If he bee couetous, then all his fooliſh imaginations will runne vpon riches. If he be giuen to bee religious, he will doe nothing but mumble of his beades, and you ſhal neuer finde him out of the Church. If he bee addicted to <hi>Venus</hi> darlings, he will doe nothing but plot the purchaſe of his loue, and ſometimes run after his owne ſhadow. As much may be ſayd of them which loue to contend in law, or of them which in their health were deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted vnto ſome one particular thing.<note place="margin">The third cauſe</note> Finally, we obſerue and finde ſuch ſtrange imaginations in ſome melancholike men, as cannot be referred either to the complexion of the bodie, or to their condition of life: the cauſe thereof remaineth vnknowne, it ſeemeth to be ſome ſecret myſterie. The old writers haue thought that there is ſome diuine thing in this humour. <hi>Rhazis</hi> and <hi>Tral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> write that they haue ſeene many melancholike perſons, which haue oftentimes foretolde what afterward hath come to paſſe.<note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and a good huntſmen.</note> There is an Arabian Phiſition, which compareth melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike men to good huntſmen. For euen (ſayth hee) as a good huntſman before he ſtrike or let goe the ſtring of his bow, doth aſſure himſelfe of the fall of the beaſt: euen ſo the melancholike perſon, by the forwardnes of his imagination, doth oftentimes ſee that which muſt come to paſſe, as though it were preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. We reade that one <hi>Marcus,</hi> and one other called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthius</hi> of Syracuſe, became good Poets after their melancholy. <hi>Anicen</hi> noteth that melancholike perſons ſometimes doe ſuch ſtrange things, that the common people imagine them to bee poſſeſſed. How many famous men be there in this our age, which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:11348:58"/>make ſcruple to condemne theſe olde witches, thinking it to bee nothing but a melancholike humour which corrupteth their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and filleth them with all theſe vaine toyes. I will not caſt my ſelfe any further into the depth of this queſtion, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter craueth a man of more leiſure. Let vs conclude therefore,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> that the varietie of things which the melancholike man buſieth himſelfe withall, commeth either of the diſpoſition of his bodie, or of his condition of life, or of ſome other cauſe which is aboue nature. They which cannot at the firſt time conceiue al theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſhall vnderſtand them (in my iudgement) if they with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience will take the paines to reade this little treatiſe, which ſhall very greatly further the making plaine of this matter, and it ſhall not be from the purpoſe. It happeneth all alike to melancholike perſons as to thoſe which dreame, and as much doe wee obſerue the cauſes of the one aas of the other: for dreames haue recourſe vnto the imagination as well as melancholie. But let vs make three ſorts of drames; the one ſort is of nature;<note place="margin">Three ſorts of dreames. Naturall dreames.</note> the other of the minde; and the third is aboue the other two. Thoſe which are of nature, doe follow the nature of the humour which doth moſt rule: the that is cholerike, dreameth of nothing but fires, fightings and burnings: the phlegmatike thinketh himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be in water. The knowledge of theſe dreames is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for a good Phiſition, thereby to know the complexion and conſtitution of his ſicke patient. <hi>Hipocrates</hi> hath written a little treaſite thereof: whereupon the famous man <hi>Iulius Caeſar Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> hath commented. <hi>Galen</hi> alſo hath made another, wherein he teacheth that by theſe naturall drames, one may foretell the iſſues of diſeaſes. They (ſayth he) which ſhould ſweate, dreame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly that they are in a bath of warme water, or in ſome riuer. There was one that dreamed that his thigh was become a ſtone, and as he awoke, the ſame thigh fell into a palſey.</p>

Some define this kinde of dreame to bee nothing elſe but that which hath paſſed the day before either through the ſences, or through the vnderſtanding. This kinde of dreame happeneth ofteſt: for if wee haue ſeene, or thought vpon, or talked of any
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:11348:59"/>thing very earneſtly in the day, the night following the ſame thing will offer it ſelfe vnto vs. The fiſherman (ſayth <hi>Theocritus</hi>) dreameth commonly of fiſhes, riuers and nets: the ſouldier of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latums, taking of nothing in the night, but of their loues obiect.</p>

               <p>I Haue largely enough deſcribed all the accidents which haunt thoſe which are properly to be tearmed melancholike perſons,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:11348:59"/>and haue ſearched out the cauſes of al theſe varities: it behoueth me now in this chapter, (to the end I may ſomewhat delight the reader) to ſet down ſome exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of ſuch as haue had the moſt fantaſticall and fooliſh imaginations of all others.<note place="margin">Strange hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> I will pick ſome out of the Greeke, Arabian, and Latine writers, and I will adde ſome ſuch as I haue ſeene with mine owne eyes. <hi>Galen</hi> in his third booke of diſeaſed parts, maketh mention of three or foure, very well worth the marking.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt.</note>There was a melancholike man which tooke himſelfe to bee a pitcher, and prayed all that came to ſee him, not to come neere vnto him, leaſt they ſhould daſh him in peeces.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note>Another imagined himſefe to be a cocke, and did crow when her heard other cockes crow, and bet his armes, as the cockes doe clap their wings.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The third.</note>Another melancholike man was greatly perplexed in himſelfe, fearing that <hi>Atlas</hi> in the end would be wearie of bearing vp hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ſo might let it fall downe vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The fourth.</note>
                  <hi>Aetius</hi> writeth of one, which thought himſelfe to haue no head, and did ſpeake it openly euery where, that there was one which had cut it off for his tyrannous dealings. This man was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very cunningly, by the skil of a Phiſition named <hi>Philotimus.</hi> For he cauſed a skull of yron waying very heauie to bee put vpon his head: and he thereupon crying that his head did grieue him, was by and by confirmed by all them that ſtood by, which alſo cried: then you haue a head; which hee acknowledged by this meanes, and ſo was freed from his falſe imagination.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The fift.</note>
                  <hi>Trallianus</hi> writeth, that he ſaw a woman which thought that ſhe had ſwallowed a Serpent, he healed her cauſing her to vomit, and caſting now and then a Serpent (which hee had and held all readie in his hand) into the baſen.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſixt.</note>I haue read that a young ſcholler being in his ſtudie, was taken with a ſtrange imaginaton: for he imagined that his noſe was ſo great and ſo long, as that he durſt not ſtirre out of his place, leaſt he ſhould daſh it againſt ſomething: and the more he was dealt with and diſſwaded, ſo much the more did he confirme himſelfe in his opinion. In the end a Phiſition hauing taken a great peece of fleſh, and holding it in his hand ſecretly, aſſured him that hee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11348:60"/>would heale him by and by, and that he muſt needes take away this great noſe: and ſo vpon the ſuddaine pinching his noſe a little, and cutting the peece of fleſh which he had, he made him beleeue that his great noſe was cut away.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſeuenth.</note>
                  <hi>Arthemidorus</hi> the Grammarian, hauing ſeene a Crocodile, was taken with ſuch a feare, as that he forgot all that euer he had knowne, and ſetled this opinion ſo deepely in himſelfe, namely. that he had loſt an arme and a legge, as that he could neuer be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the contrarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The eight.</note>There haue been ſeene very melancholike perſons, which did thinke themſelues dead, and would not eate any thing: the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue vſed this ſleight to make them eate. They cauſed ſome one or other ſeruant to lie neere vnto the ſicke partie, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taught him to counterfeite himſelfe dead, yet not to forſake his meate, but to eate and ſwallow it, when it was put into his mouth: and thus by this craftie deuiſe, they perſwaded the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike man, that the dead did eate as well as thoſe which are aliue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ninth.</note>There hath been ſeene not long ſince, a melancholike man, which affirmed himſelfe the moſt wretched and miſerable in all the world, becauſe he was nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The tenth.</note>There was alſo of late a great Lord, which thought himſelfe to be glaſſe, and had not his imagination troubled, otherwiſe then in this one onely thing, for he could ſpeake meruailouſlie well of any other thing: he vſed commonly to ſit, and tooke great delight that his friends ſhould come and ſee him, but ſo as that he would deſire them, that they would not come neere vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The eleuenth.</note>There is yet an honeſt man, and one of the beſt French Poets that is in this Realme, which is fallen within theſe few yeares into a fooliſh conceite. Being courſed with a continuall feauer, which was accompanied with much watching, the Phiſitions appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him a ſtupefactiue oyntment, called <hi>Populeon,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with rubbed his noſe forehead, and temples, ſince which houre, he hath <hi>Populeon</hi> in ſuch hatefull loathſomenes, as that euer ſince, he caſteth them from him, and will weare them no more: in other
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:11348:60"/>points hee is able to talke very ſenſiblie, and ceaſeth not to goe forward in his Poetrie. It hath been attempted by all the skilfull meanes in the world, to take from him this fooliſh conceite, he hath been ſhewed the deſcription of the oyntment, to put him out of doubt that there goeth no dangerous thing to the making of it, he knoweth it, and is of the ſame minde, but yet this conceite is ſo deepely printed in him, as that hitherto no man hath attayned to know how to diſplace it.</p>

                  <hi>Aretaeus</hi> in his firſt booke of long diſeaſes, ſaith that he hath ſeene a melancholike man, who hath imagined himſelfe to be of bricke, and would not drinke therefore, fearing leaſt thereby he ſhould haue been diſſolued.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth.</note>Another imagined that his feete were made of glaſſe, and durſt not walke leaſt he ſhould haue broke them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The fifteenth.</note>The pleaſanteſt dotage that euer I read, was of one <hi>Sienois</hi> a Gentleman, who had reſolued with himſelfe not to piſſe, but to dye rather, and that becauſe he imagined, that when he firſt piſſed, all his towne would be drowned. The Phiſitions ſhewing him, that all his bodie, and ten thouſand moe ſuch as his, were not able to containe ſo much as might drowne the leaſt houſe in the towne, could not change his minde from this fooliſh imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In the end they ſeeing his obſtinacie, and in what danger he put his life, found out a pleaſant inuention. They cauſed the next houſe to be ſet on fire, &amp; all the bells in the town to ring, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded diuerſe ſeruants to crie, to the fire, to the ſire, &amp; therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſend of thoſe of the beſt account in the town, to craue helpe, and ſhew the Gentleman that there is but one way to ſaue the towne, and that it was, that he ſhould piſſe quickelie and quench the ſire. Then this ſillie melancholike man which abſtained from piſſing for feare of looſing his towne, taking it for graunted, that it was now in great hazard, piſſed and emptied his bladder of all that was in it, and was himſelfe by that meanes preſerued.

It followeth ſometimes the hote ſickeneſſes of the braine, as frenſies and burning feauers, and then the face appearethred. <hi>Auicen</hi> obſerueth that ſtammerers, and ſuch as haue rowling eyes, and ſuch as are hairie and blacke, ſuch alſo as haue great veines and thicke lippes, are moſt inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this kinde of melancholie: ſadnes, feare, deepe muſes, the vſe of groſſe and melancholike meates doe oftentimes cauſe this diſeaſe.</p>

Or elſe you may haue a great veſſell full of warme water, which will keepe the ayre moyſt continually. It will be needefull to perfume the chamber with Orange flowers, Citron pilles, and a little Storax: the chamber muſt be lightſome, and ſtanding toward the Eaſt.

The Arabians commend the braines of things to be good againſt melancholie, by I cannot tell what propertie: but in my iudgement, they be not very proper and fit, ſeeing they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto the ſtomacke, and I take them to haue been too ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious in a great number of things.</p>

If a man doubt the ſweete ſent, hee may caſt a bunch of the flowres of Borage onely, or of the hearbe it ſelfe alſo into the wine which he ordinarilie drinketh.</p>
               <p>Watching is altogether enemie to thoſe that are troubled with this diſeaſe, for we muſt with all the skill and cunning we can, procure ſleepe, the meanes to doe it, follow in the next chapter. Moderate exerciſe may ſerue to very good purpoſe, but it muſt be done in pleaſant and delightſome places, as gardens, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, greene-plots, in places where there are many water ſprings, or ſome riuers: a man muſt not tyre himſelfe in theſe exerciſes, he muſt reſt himſelfe oft.</p>
               <p>Melancholike perſons ſhould neuer be alone, they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way haue ſome ſuch companie left with them, as might beſt like and pleaſe them, ſometimes they muſt bee flattered, and yeelded vnto in ſome part of that which they deſire, for feare leaſt this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which is rebellious by nature, and giuen to ſelfe wilfulnes,

To be ſhort, wee muſt turne backe and driue away as much as wee can from their vnderſtanding, al maner of paſſions ouerthrowing the mind, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially choler, feare and ſadnes: for as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith in his Dialogue called <hi>Charmides,</hi> the greateſt part of the miſchiefes that fall vpon the bodie, doe come from the minde.<note place="margin">Muſicke very meete for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike perſons.</note> The old writers doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Muſicke in all melancholike diſeaſes, whether they bee hot or cold.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:11348:63"/>the meanes and remedies, neither giuing eare to good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, nor yet obeying the holeſome precepts of Phiſicke. And to be ſhort it is the very ſcourge and torment of Phiſitions. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his ſeuenth booke of Ethikes ſayth, that melancholike folk haue alwaies ſomething which doth gnaw and feede vpon them: and this is the cauſe why they are alwaies running after the Phiſition, and yet we ought not to leaue them helpleſſe. I will ſet downe in this chapter the moſt ſpeciall remedies that I haue been able to obſerue, together with the order how ſuch melancholike perſons muſt be handled.</p>

The diminutiues are either letting of blood, or purgation. As concerning the letting of blood which is vniuerſall,<note place="margin">Blood-letting reſpecting the whole body.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> appointeth it to be miniſtred, in that melancholy which is within the veines, and throughout the whole habite of the bodie, and willeth that if the blood iſſuing ſhew fayre and thinne, that it bee ſtayed by and by: but in that melancholie which hath his ſeate in the braine, and which commeth of a colde and drie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature, he hath forbidden it moſt expreſſely. The Arabians commend in the cure of this kinde of melancholie,<note place="margin">Blood-letting reſpecting ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts.</note> the letting of blood called particular, to the taking away of the conioyned cauſe: they open the veines of the forehead, of the noſe, and of the eares; they ſet cupping-glaſſes vpon the ſhoulders, hauing firſt ſcarified the place; they apply horſeleaches vpon the head, and in all melancholike diſeaſes, whether eſſentiall or accidentall; they cauſe the hemorrhoides to be opened, hauing the eleuenth Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme of the ſixt booke for their ground and warrant, which ſaith, that in melancholike and mad men the varicous tumour or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoides appearing, doe heale the ſame: but all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar openings of a veine haue no place in the beginning of this diſeaſe.<note place="margin">Purging.</note> Wee muſt begin with that other kinde of euacuation, which is purgation. It may bee performed by the often vſing of Cliſter, Decoctions, Syrupes, and Opiates: the forme of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cliſter for melancholike perſons, ſhall be ſuch as followeth.

As concerning the firſt, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the principal cauſe of the diſeaſe which is this burning deſire, being taken away, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed partie will finde himſelfe marueilouſly relieued, though not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there may remaine behinde ſome certaine prints and skarres in the bodie.<note place="margin">Hiſtories. The firſt.</note> So <hi>Eraſistratus</hi> hauing diſcouered vnto <hi>Seleucus</hi> the griefe of his ſonne <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who was like to dye for the loue of his mother in law, ſaued the life of the young man: for the father hauing compaſſion vpon his ſonne, and ſeeing him in extreme perill of his life, ſuffered him (as being a Pagan) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the vſe of his owne wife.<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> 
                  <hi>Diogenes</hi> hauing a ſonne forciblie and ragingly diſtracted by vnbrideled luſt, was conſtrained (after he had conſulted with the oracles of <hi>Apollo</hi>) to ſuffer him to inioy his beſt beloued, and by this meanes to heale him.<note place="margin">The third, and that very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</note> I haue in times paſt read a pleaſant hiſtorie of a young man of Egypt, who ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red extreame pinching gripes, for the loue of a Curtiſane called
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11348:70"/>
                  <hi>Theognis,</hi> and yet was not regarded of her, as one that ſtood vpon an exceſſiue ſumme of ſiluer. It happened that this miſerable loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaue dreamed on a night, that hee held his miſtreſſe in his armes, and that ſhe was altogether at his commund: whereupon when he a waked, he wel perceiued that this inward fire which whilome fed greedily vpon him, and thereby about to conſume him, was become cold &amp; vtterly quenched, ſo that he ſought not any more after the Curtiſane: who when ſhe was aduertiſed of the whole matter as it ſtood, cauſed the young man to bee called before the ſeate of Iuſtice, alleaging for ſuch her fact, this only reaſon, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſhe had healed him. <hi>Bochor</hi> the Iudge did by and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point that the yong man ſhould bring a purſe full of crownes, and powre them forth into a baſen, that thereby Curtiſane might pay her ſelfe of the ringing ſound and colour of the crownes, as he had ſatisfied himſelfe of the ſole imagination. The ſentence was well like of all, excepted onely the cape Curtiſane <hi>Lamia,</hi> which ſhewed vnto her friend <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that the dreame had vtterly quenched and taken away all maner of Iuſt from the young man, but that the ſight of the gold had inflamed and increaſed a great deale more <hi>Theognis</hi> her deſire, and that for this cauſe the matter was not equally proceeded in. My purpoſe in alleadging theſe three hiſtories, is to ſhew that this rage and furie of erotike loue, may be ſtaied by the inioying of the thing beloued. But this courſe of cure being ſuch as neither ought nor can alwaies be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, as being contrary vnto the lawes of God and men, we muſt haue recourſe vnto the other which dependeth vpon the induſtrie of the good Phiſition.<note place="margin">The ſecond way to cure the amorous melancholie. Faire words and cunning ſpeeches.</note> If therefore it happen vnto any Phiſition to meete with ſome of theſe melancholike patients, thus rauiſhed of loue, hee muſt firſt of all aſſay to draw him with fayre words from theſe fond and fooliſh imaginations, ſhewing him the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whereinto he doth caſt himſelfe headlong, and ſetting before him the examples of ſuch as haue been ouerthrowne thereby, as not onely loſing their liues, that their ſoules alſo. If all this doe no good, wee muſt by ſome other wile, and by the ſetting a worke of diuers men, ſtriue to make him hate that, which ſo tormenteth him, as in affirming the thing to bee euill, in calling his miſtreſſe, light, inconſtant, fooliſh, deuoted to varietie, mocking and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:11348:70"/>to ſcorne this his griefe and corraſiue, diſdainfull as not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his deſerts, and one which loueth better a baſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to glut her brutiſh luſt, then to intertaine an honeſt and chaſt loue. And looke how deeply you diſpraiſe his Ladie, ſo highly ſhall you praiſe himſelfe, declaring the excellencie of his vnderſtanding, his worthines and deſerts. If words be not ſufficient and able to cure this inchauntment, as in very deede they can doe very little in place where melancholike conceitednes hath taken roote, wee muſt bethinke our ſelues of ſome other courſe. Remouing, that is to ſay, the chaunging of the ayre,<note place="margin">Change of ayre.</note> is one of the rareſt remedies, becauſe that vnder colour of that wee may beſtow him in ſome remote place, and ſend him quite out of the countrie: for the ſight of his miſtreſſe doth daily blow vp the coles of his deſire, and the only reciting of her name, ſerueth as a baite for his ardent affections to bite vpon. It will bee good for him,<note place="margin">Exerciſes.</note> to lodge in the fields, or in ſome pleaſant houſe; to cauſe him to walke often; to keepe him occupied euery houre with one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſant paſtime; to bring into his minde a hundred and a hundred ſundrie things, to the end he may haue no leiſure to think of his loue; to carrie him out a hunting; to the fenceſchoole; to holde him vp ſometimes with fine and graue ſtories; ſometime with pleaſant tales; and therewith to haue merrie muſicke: you muſt not feede him too full or daintily, leaſt the blood beginning to waxe hot, ſhould rouſe vp the fleſh and thereby renew the olde fire. Take away idleneſſe, take away bellie cheere, and quaffing of ſtrong drinkes, and without doubt lecherie will fall ſtarke lame.</p>
               <p>The Poets faigne that Ladie Lecherie could neuer inſnare (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all her wiles and ſubtile inchauntments) theſe three Goddeſſes, <hi>Pallas, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Vesta: Pallas</hi> painteth out vnto vs the ſtate of warriours; <hi>Diana</hi> of hunters; and <hi>

I was called to the opening of the bodie, becauſe that ordinarilie I had counſelled him in his ſickenes, together with one of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Phiſitions, <hi>Mounſer Hucher</hi> Chancellour of our Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whom I am willing for honour ſake to name, and as knowing him to be one of the moſt learned and beſt practiſed Phiſitions of our times. I found his breaſt halfe full of blacke and ſtinking water, therewith the left ventricle of the heart was all filled, and in the trunke of the great arterie, a man might ſee the ſame colour. At which time I calling to minde a notable place in <hi>Galen,</hi> in his ſixth booke of diſeaſed parts, I ſhewed vnto the companie, that the cauſe of theſe faintings, and of his earneſt deſire to piſſe, came of this curſed humour, which hauing pained the heart, paſſed from
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:11348:75"/>thence by the arteries vnto the reynes,<note place="margin">A worthie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation for the defence of Galen.</note> and from thence vnto the bladder. It was my intent to ſtand vpon this by the waie, that ſo I may take occaſion to defend <hi>Galen</hi> againſt the falſe accuſations of young Phiſitions, which thinke that putrified and purulent matter gathered in the breaſts of thoſe which are troubled with the diſeaſe Empyema and Pleuriſies, cannot purge and conuay it ſelfe away by the heart or arteries.

                  <note place="margin">The ſecond hiſtorie.</note>The other hiſtorie is alſo very ſtrange, I obſerued it this winter at <hi>Towers,</hi> and was called to counſaile about the ſame, with <hi>Mounſer Anſelmeau, Valeſeau</hi> and <hi>Vertunian,</hi> very learned Phiſitions, and of great experience. A young Lord euer ſince he was eight or nine yeares olde, was troubled with this <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driake</hi> diſeaſe: he heard euery day about nine of the clocke in the morning, a little noyſe on his ſpleene ſide: afterward he perceiued avapour to riſe which made all his breaſt and face red, and ſeazed the top of his head, the veines of his temples did beate very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciblie, the veines of his face were puffed vp, and at the corners of his browes where the veines doe end, he felt an extreame paine, which paſſed not the breadth of a ſhilling, the rednes ran all along his left arme, euen vnto the fingers ends, and was like a Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies</hi> fire or cholerike tumour, called <hi>Eriſipelas,</hi> the right ſide went altogether ſcorfree.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are neceſſarie for the curing of the <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driake</hi> diſeaſe, two ſorts of remedies. The one to be appoynted and vſed when the fit is not, and they are called preſeruatiues: the other are to be vſed in the time of the fit, euen then when the partie is haunted of all theſe accidents: but I will begin with the former. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of a man from this diſeaſe,<note place="margin">To preſerue a man from the Hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake diſeeaſe. Euacuating medecines. Blood letting.</note> is attempted by three kindes of remedies, namely, <hi>Diminutiues, Alteratiues,</hi> and <hi>Corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.</hi> The <hi>Diminutiues</hi> are letting of blood and purging: vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Phlebotomie may ſerue to correct the hote diſtemperature of the liuer, and to emptie away ſome part of melancholike blood; it muſt be done vpon the Baſilike veine, which the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians call the blacke veine. The opening of particular veines, as the <hi>Hamorrhoids</hi> is counted amongſt the number of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and ſure remedies for the cure of the <hi>Hypochondriake,</hi> in as much as they emptie the ſpleene, and all the <hi>Meſeraicke</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane. There are ſome which praiſe the opening of that veine which goeth to the little finger of the left hand, which is called <hi>Saluatella.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Furging.</note> The other diminutiue is performed by purgation, which muſt not be ſtrong, leaſt this humour ſhould growe more fierce. You muſt purge therefore very gentlie, and at ſeuerall times. The purgations muſt be ſuch as purge fleagme and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, becauſe theſe are the two humours which doe moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: Sene and Agaricke haue the chiefe and principall place. I haue deſcribed in the chapter of the firſt melancholie, the receipts of many purgations which may ſerue heere in this place, but for as much as the humour cauſing the windie melancholie, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:11348:76"/>pound, we muſt beforced to ſet downe ſome other fort.<note place="margin">A magiſtrall Syrupe.</note> I like and approue of magiſtrall ſyrupes and Opiates greatly, and they may be framed after this faſhion. Take the rootes of Bugloſſe and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peragus, the rindes of the rootes of Capers-tree and Tamariske, of each an ounce, the rootes and leaues, of Succorie, Borage, Bugloſſe, Hops, Fumitorie, Ceterach, Maidens haire, of each a Handfull, of Sea wormewood and Balme a pugill, of Licoriſe and Corans waſht in warme water, of each an ounce, of the ſeedes of Citrons, bleſſed Thiſtle and Endiue, of each two drammes, of the three cordiall flowres, of the flowers of Succorie, of the crops of Tyme and Epythymum, of each a pugill, boyle them all in a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantitie of cleere water, and hauing ſtrained it well, take two pintes thereof, and adde thereto of the infuſion of orientall Sene, made in the former decoction, with a dramme of Cloues, an ounce and a halfe of the infuſion of Agaricke, made in the water of Minthes, with a ſcruple of Ginger, and with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Sugar, boyle them all together, to the height of a ſyrupe, which you ſhall keepe for your ordinarie vſe. Hereof you muſt take two ounces once euery moneth, or twiſe, with the broth of a Chicken, wherein are put Borage, Bugloſſe, Hops, and the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hearbes: you may make a ſyrupe with the iuyces of the ſame hearbes, and put thereto the ſame laxatiues.<note place="margin">An Opiate.</note> The Opiate that I haue ſet downe, may ſerue here, but it may be made of a far other faſhion, which purgeth moſt gentlie. Take of the iuyce of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie well purified, as much as ſhall neede, infuſe therein for the ſpace of foure and twentie howres, two ounces of Orientall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and cauſing them to boyle once, afterward ſtraine them ſtrongly, and after boyle the licour ſtrained out, with Sugar, till it come to the forme of an Electuarie, whereunto you ſhall adde of Caſſia new drawne out of the cane, two ounces, of Epithymum, halfe an ounce, of Cloues made in powder, two drammes, the mixing all well together, you ſhall make an Opiate whereof you may take halfe an ounce or more.</p>
               <p>They which cannot vſe decoctions nor Opiates, ſhall take pils,<note place="margin">The extraction of Sene to be made into pilles.</note> made of the extract of Sene, Agaricke and Rubarbe, for other pilles are not ſo fit in this diſeaſe. Take of good Polypodie foure ounces, the rootes and leaues of Succorie, Bugloſſe, Fumitorie,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11348:77"/>Hops, of each a handfull, of damaske Raiſines a dozen, of the three cordiall flowers one handfull: make a decoction vnto a pint, and boyle therein two ounces and a halfe of Sene, of Epithymum ſixe drammes, of good Agaricke halfe an ounce: all theſe hauing infuſed together one whole night, ſtraine and preſſe them out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrongly, putting thereto of good Rubarbe, which ſhall be infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the foreſayd decoction with a little Cinamome, halfe an ounce: afterward you ſhall put all this together vpon hote aſhes, you ſhall thereupon drie them, til they come to a reaſonable thick conſiſtence, and then putting thereto of Epithymum three drams, you ſhall make all vp into a maſſe of pilles, which will purge very gently if you giue thereof at one time the quantitie of foure ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And let theſe ſerue for gentle and eaſie purgations; only you may adde hereunto the often vſe of Cliſters, which may ſerue for the windie melancholie. But for as much as this humour is groſſe, and for the moſt part lurking in the moſt inward veines, it is not very eaſie to purge it well, if it bee not firſt prepared: wee muſt come therefore vnto the ſecond kind of remedies, which we haue called Alteratiues.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Inward Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiues.</note>The alteration to be made muſt conſiſt in moyſtning and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thin of this humour: this may bee done by inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward remedies.<note place="margin">Apozemes.</note> The inward are Apozemes, which muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what opening becauſe of obſtructions, and it muſt be looked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with great care, that they be not made with too hot a fire. It will bee very fit to make them of ſuch hearbes as properly reſpect the liuer and the ſpleene, and amongſt the reſt wee muſt not forget Wormewood: for all good practitioners doe confidently affirme, that the onely decoction of Wormewood hath preſerued an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of perſons from the windie melancholie. It will not bee amiſſe to lay in ſteepe theſe groſſe humours, and for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the veſſels to commaund to bee vſed the decoction of the roote China with a little Saſſafras for the ſpace of twelue or fifteene daies.<note place="margin">The vſe of the roote China. Broths.</note> Broths that doe alter and moyſten the humour, the maner of liuing and vſe of milke will ſerue marueilouſly well for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and moyſtning of this drie humour.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Outward alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiues.</note>As concerning outward remedies, bathes for the whole bodie deſerue to be moſt chiefly accounted of: there may fomentations
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:11348:77"/>alſo bee applied to the ſpleene, and all ouer <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> as alſo oyntments and liniments. The fomentations muſt be mollifying, ſomewhat opening and making thinne or apt to attenuate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mixt therewithall ſome carminatiues or things to breake winde: the manner of making them is common enough. The oyles of Capers, bitter Almonds, Broome, Elder, Lillies,<note place="margin">Of the berries.</note> Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, &amp; Danewort berries, are moſt fit &amp; proper. The laſt kind of remedies is of ſuch as are corroboratiues,<note place="margin">Comiortable medicines.</note> for there are in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the windie melancholie many parts that are much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hauing bin branded with this humor: as the hart, the ſtomack and the braine. The weakenes of the heart is cauſed through the beating and light faintings ofthe ſame; the weake ſtomacke fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all full of cruditie; the weakened braine cauſeth that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and reaſon are oftentimes troubled in this diſeaſe. Wee muſt therefore haue regard vnto theſe parts.<note place="margin">Meanes to comfort the heart. An Opiate.</note> The heart is ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by inward and outward meanes: the inward, are Opiates, Condites, and Lozenges. Take the conſerue of the rootes of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſſe, and of the flowers of Borage, of each an ounce; of the fleſh of <hi>Mirobalanes</hi> and of the rindes of Citrons confected, of each halfe an ounce; of the confection of Alkermes two drammes;<note place="margin">Confectionis laetificantis.</note> of Pearle and of the powder of Mirth, of each one dramme: make thereof an Opiate with the ſyrupe of Apples, whereof you muſt take twice or thrice euery weeke, with a little of the water of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſſe. Take of the powder of the electuarie of precious ſtones and of Mirth, of each a dram;<note place="margin">Lozenges.</note> of the confection of Alkermes halfe a dram; of Pearle &amp; Emerald made in powder, of each one ſcruple; of Sugar diſſolued in the water of Bugloſſe or Balme ſo much as needeth, make vp Lozenges of the waight of 3. drams: you muſt take hereof euening and morning twice or thrice euery weeke.</p>
               <p>For ſuch as are more delicate and daintie, there are ſome that make confections of Muske.<note place="margin">Musk-cordials.</note> Take the third part of a Nutmeg confected, of the rindes of Citrons three drammes, and as much of <hi>Mirobalanes</hi> confected, of Ambergriſe halfe a dramme, and as much of Muske, of Sugar the double quantitie of all the reſt, and with the muſcilage of Gumme Tragacanth drawne in the water of Bugloſſe make Muſcardins. You muſt not often vſe theſe hote
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11348:78"/>medicines in the <hi>Hypochondriake</hi> diſeaſe, for feare of mouing and enraging of the humour.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.

Thus much concerning the proper remedies as well inward as outward for the ſtrengthening of the heart, and taking away of ſuch weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as commonly happeneth to them that haue the windie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie.</p>

And for this cauſe you may annoint the liuer with the oyntment of Roſes and Saunders well waſhed in Succorie water: or elſe you ſhall apply thereupon Epithemes of the waters of Succorie, Endiue, Sorrell, the ſeedes of Endiue, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall flowers and red Saunders. As concerning the braine which is weake, to the end it may not be ſubiect to ſo great quantitie of vapours, you may ſtrengthen it with powders appropriate for the head, and ſleight parfumes.</p>
               <p>And thus much as concerning preſeruatiues which are to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when the fit is not, and which without all doubt will keepe the fit from comming: for taking a way the cauſe of accidents, it muſt needes fall out that the effects ceaſe.<note place="margin">Remedies to be vſed in the acceſſe of the diſease.</note> But when the fit of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die melancholie ſhall put the ſicke partie in paines, you muſt vſe other meanes, which the Phiſition ſhall alter and varie according to the accident, which is moſt ſtrong and vrgent.

You may in like manner apply vpon the region of the ſpleene fomentations, which will reſolue and waſte ſome part of theſe groſſe vapours. Theſe are the three ſortes of melancholie, which ancient writers haue deliuered vnto vs, that is to ſay, that which hath his ſeat in the braine, that which commeth of the ſympathie of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and that which ariſeth ordinarily from the places about the ſhort ribbes, which is more common then either of the other, and which is ſo often happening in theſe miſerable times, as that there are not many people which feele not ſome ſmatch thereof.

But indeed this marrowie ſubſtance is not ſo called for any reſemblance it hath with the marrow in the hollow parts of other bones: for it ſerueth not for nouriſhment vnto the skull; it melteth not with fire nor conſumeth; his originall is more excellent; for it is made with the other parts, that are of the pureſt and fineſt portion of the two ſeeds.

I will follow the leuelling line of my diſcourſe, and ſay that the braine being of a ſoft ſubſtance and of a cold and moyſt temperature (being compared with the reſt of the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) doth beget many excrements:<note place="margin">That the brain doth beget great ſtore of excrements of it ſelfe.</note> and for that it is nouriſhed with a cold and raw blood, there muſt needes remaine great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſſages, and ſo it cannot but beget great ſtore of ſuperfluities: in ſuch ſort as that of it ſelfe and of it owne proper nature it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſpoſed, to beget and containe water. It be getteth much alſo in reſpect of his ſhape and ſituation. His forme which is round, hollow and long, after the manner of a cupping glaſſe, draweth vnto it from all the parts of the bodie their exhalations. His ſituation which is aloft doth eaſily receiue them: ſo that theſe hote vapours falling into a part or member that is more cold, doe grow thicke and turne into water. As wee ſee the vapours riſing, vpon the fire kindled in the parts about the ſhort ribs, when they come to the skinne (which is more cold) to congeale and turne to ſweate: Or a s exhalations drawne vp by the heate of the Sunne, doe thicken in the middle region of the ayre, and turne into raine, haile, and ſnow. See then how the braine both of it ſelfe, as alſo by accident, is apt to ingender excrements, and how in euery li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thing it may be called the principall ſeate of cold and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: but chiefly in man, for as much as according to the varietie of the animall functions which he executeth, he aboundeth with greater quantitie of braine, then any other liuing thing doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the braine be of a good temperature, it will not ingender any excrements, but ſuch as are naturall to it, and accordingly auoide them euery daye by ſuch paſſages as nature bath aſſigned it: but and if it be diſtempered, it will gather a great deale moe then it ought, which either of their owne weightines (ſuch is their elementarie forme) will fall downe into the lower parts, or elſe will be thruſt out into ſome other part, by the vertue expulſiue of the braine, which ſhall feele it ſelfe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, either with the quantitie or euill qualitie of the ſame. This falling downe of humours in what maner ſo euer it be,<note place="margin">What is meant by the word rheume.</note> is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie called of the Greekes a Catarrhe, which ſignifieth as much as diſtillation. I know very well, that there is a more ſtrict ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this name, and that as <hi>Galen</hi> obſerueth very well in his third of the cauſes of accidents, a Catarrhe is properly when the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour falleth downe into the mouth: but I will reſt my ſelfe in this place with the moſt common ſignification, and will call all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of falling downe of humours from the braine, into what part ſoeuer it be, a Catarrhe, rheume, or diſtillation.</p>
               <p>Rheume if we beleeue <hi>Galen,</hi> is an accident of the third kinde, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">That the rheume is an accident.</note> an error in the excrements: this accident ordinarilie followeth another, and that is the weakning of ſome action; the action in this caſe weakened or hurt, is concoction. For the braine not being able to diſgeſt his nouriſhment well, ingendreth grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtore of ſuperfluities then it ought.<note place="margin">This diſeaſe that cauſeth this accident.</note> The concoction offended, being an accident: doth immediatly depend vpon ſome diſeaſe. I thinke that this is for the moſt parta colde and moiſt diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:11348:81"/>a drie diſtemperature may by accident ſometimes bee cauſe hereof, as in detayning the vapours, and hindring them from paſſing any further; a hote diſtemperature alſo may be the cauſe in reſoluing the humours preſent, and too much drawing of the vapours abſent, but this happeneth but ſeldome. The braine then is the part that is principally diſeaſed in the caſe of rheumes. The diſeaſe is a diſtemperature, which immediatly hurteth the digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the member diſtempered, and of this hurt of diſgeſtion commeth that, which is amiſſe in the excrement.<note place="margin">The definition of rheume.</note> But to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature of a rheume, it is needefull to play the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in this ſort. A rheume<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or diſtillation, is no other thing then the mouing of humours from one place to another, which the Philoſophers call locall. But in euery locall motion,<note place="margin">Fiue things to be noted in a rheume.</note> 
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath obſerued fiue things in his Phiſicke: The moueable, that is to ſay, the thing which is moued; the mouing, that is to ſay, the thing which doth make the motion; and three tearmes or limits, as the place from whence the motion began, the place by which the motion was made, and the place where ſuch motion ſtaied and ended. In rheumes the moued, is a humour of what condition ſoeuer it bee, as whether hot or colde, gentle, ſharpe, ſalte, thin,<note place="margin">1. The moued.</note>thicke, ſimple or compound. The mouer of this humour,<note place="margin">2. The motiue or mouer.</note> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of it to change his place, (which is called in one word the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue) is twofold, the one inward, and the other outward. Againe, the inward is twofold: the forme of the humour, and the foule,<note place="margin">The inward mouer.</note> that is to ſay, the power expulſiue: the humour if it follow his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and clementarie forme, muſt euermore of neceſſitie fall downeward, becauſe it is heauie and weightie. But it often falleth out that the humour being no longer within the power and iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the ſoule (as when the retentiue facultie is altogether weakened) falleth downe of it ſelfe, hauing no other motiue of ſuch motion, but onely his owne forme or weightines. So we ſee the moſt part of them which die, to be ſmothered with a rheume, the braine hauing altogether loſt his force, and being (as it were) reſolued. The other originall that moueth the humours being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is the ſoule; for nature hath giuen vnto euery liuing part a vertue expulſiue, to expell whatſoeuer may annoy it. The braine then (being ſtirred vp, either by the aboundance of the humour
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:11348:82"/>which oppreſſeth it, or by the qualitie which ſtingeth and biteth it) ſtraineth it ſelfe to expell it,<note place="margin">The outward mouer.</note> and to thruſt it from it, as far as euer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it can. The outward motiue is all that which from without may pinch and preſſe together, relaxe or looſen, or ſhake the braine: the colde ayre preſſeth the braine together, and cauſeth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to fall downe; the ayre and bathes that are hote, doe looſen and reſolue the humours; ſtrokes fals, and violent paſſions of the minde, may ſhake the humour which is within the braine, and make it change his place. And thus much for the mouing or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. It remaineth that we finde out the three tearmes or boundes within which euery locall motion is bounded. The place from whence the humour beginneth to moue,<note place="margin">The end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the motion beginneth.</note> is within, and without the braine. The humour oftentimes keepeth within the ventricles, and the whole ſubſtance of the braine, and beginneth to departe from thence: ſometimes it keepeth without the braine, betwixt the bone and his membrane, and cauſeth outward diſtillations. The places by orthrough,<note place="margin">The bounds through which.</note> which the humour falleth (which is the ſecond bound) are the ordinarie and extraordinarie paſſages of the braine, the ordinarie are the noſe and the Palate: the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie are the eyes, eares, ſinewes, marrow, veines, arteries, and ſpace which is betwixt the bones and the membranes, or the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the muſcles.<note place="margin">The bounds, where it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</note> The tearme and limit where the humour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his courſe, may bee any part of the bodie, prouided that it bee in an inferiour region, or place that is lower then the head, and therewithall weake; for you ſhall neuer finde a rheume to riſe from a lower part vpward.

                  <note place="margin">Differences of rheumes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the matter that makes them.</note>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He principall differences of rheume, are taken from the matter that falleth downe; from the parts receiuing or ſending, from the accidents accompanying the ſame, and from the maner of their generation. The matter of al rheumes is a humour: I call a humour all that which is actuallie liquid, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:11348:82"/>ſwimmeth. But in the humour we may obſerue many things: the ſubſtance, temperature, qualitie, taſte, and mixture, and from euery one of theſe wee ſhall draw ſome differences of rheumes. The ſubſtance or conſiſtence of the humour (for ſo Phiſitions are accuſtomed to ſpeake) is either thin and ſubtile,<note place="margin">The firſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence drawne from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the humour. The ſecond difference from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.</note> or groſſe and thicke, or indifferent, and betwixt both. There are then ſome rheumes that are ſubtile, thin, and ſharpe, and there are others more thicke. The temperature of the humour is hote or colde, ſo then there are hot, and there are cold rheumes; but colde rheumes are more common, and are begotten of a colde and moiſt diſtem perature of the braine: the colde diſtemperarure weakeneth the concocting facultie, and cauſeth the braine to gather moe excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then it needeth, and that it cannot diſgeſt the remainder of his colde nouriſhment. The moiſt diſtemperature weakeneth the retentiue facultie, and ſuffereth the humours to fall downe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee not ſuperfluous.<note place="margin">Signes of a colde rheume.</note> Men may diſcerne this colde rheume by many ſignes, for the humour that falleth downe, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſharpe or pricking, the braine is drowſely inclined, the eyes daſeled, the hearing heauie, the noſtrils ſtopt, all the ſences dull, the face pale, the bodie ſlowe, heauie and lumpiſh, becauſe that the ſtrength of the armes and legges, commeth of the ſtiffenes of the muſcles and ſinewes, but in this caſe the ſinewes are ſoftned, and as it were relaxed, becauſe the braine which is their common ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and fountaine, doth ſwim all in water. The Phiſition ſhall obſerue yet for his further aſſurance, the temperature, age, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, ſeaſon of the yeare, and order of life: for if the bodie be of a colde temperature, if it be olde, if he dwell in colde, waterie and mariſhie places, and that it be in winter; if he eate ordinarilie of raw fruites, of moyſt and colde victuals, and if he liue an idle and ſlouthfull ſitting life, we neede not doubt but that it is a colde rheume. There be alſo hot rheumes,<note place="margin">Hote rheumes.</note> howſoeuer that many learned Phiſitions denie it, for wee are confirmed in the contrarie, both by the authoritie of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and our owne experience. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> maketh mention of a ſommer ſquinancie, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of a ſubtile, ſharpe, and hot diſtillation: and we ſee come forth at the noſe oftentimes, a yellow and cholericke humour, which taketh off all the skin, and it is ingendred ordinarilie of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:11348:83"/>choler in the braine, which is purged out from thence by the cares. The olde writers haue obſerued very well, that there are three ſorts of excrements ingendred in the braine, as, one ſorte of fleagme; another ſort of melancholie, and another ſort choler: The fleagmatike paſſe away by the mouth and noſe, the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike by the eyes, and the cholerike by the eares: wee ſee alſo when wee make cleane our eares, that all that commeth forth is yellow, and extreame bitter. Then there are hot rheumes, which are ſuch either by their generation, as if they be made of choler; or by corruption, as when fleagme putrifieth, it getteth a certaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimonie, and becommeth ſalt.<note place="margin">The ſignes of a hot rheume.</note> It is eaſie to finde out theſe hot rheumes: for if the humour paſſe by the palate and mouth, they taſte it bitter and pricking, it burneth and taketh off the skin euery where, where it commeth; the face is all red and fierie, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head extreame hot, and commonly it walketh hand in hand with an ague: we muſt adde vnto all this a temperature that is hot and cholericke, a hot conſtitution of ayre, a maner of liuing, and all other things which are apt to heate the humours, and to ingender ſuch as are hote.<note place="margin">The third dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference riſeth from the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</note> We obſerue furthermore in the humour (beſides his ſubſtance and temperature) what his qualitie is, that is to ſay, the maners thereof: for there are ſome humours which are mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and haue a certaine ſecret malignitie, there are ſome more gentle, there are ſome that are concocted, and ſome that are crude and raw. From theſe conditions wee ſhall finde a difference of rheumes; as, there are ſome that are rebellious, as thoſe which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie the french diſeaſe, or which riſe of ſome remainder thereof, and theſe are not cured by ordinarie remedies, they muſt be ouercome by ſoueraigne cordials and preſeruatiues: there are other ſome more gentle,<note place="margin">Signes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concocted rheumes. The ſourth difference ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the taſte of the rheume.</note> which are eaſilie cured and helped by ſome ſimple purgation: there are ſome that are crude, and ſome concocted: it is known to be crude, when we ſee it cleere, thin, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, greene, yellow, bitter or pricking: contrarilie, if it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall and euery where alike, and a little thicke, we judge it to be concocted. We take ſome difference of rheumes from the taſte and ſauour which is in the humour, there are ſalte, ſweete, ſharpe, and taſtleſſe ſauours: the ſalt ones are alwaies moſt dangerous, for if they fall ones vpon the Lungs, they cauſe an vlcer; if among the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:11348:83"/>guts, a bloodie fluxe: finally, we may drawe from the mixture of the humours, theſe differences. There are ſimple rheumes, cauſed of one onely humour, and there are others which are made of the mixture of many. And thus much concerning the particular viewe of the firſt difference, which is taken from the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond difference ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the parts.</note>The ſecond difference may be gathered from the parts: now we haue two forts of parts to looke into, as the ſending, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing parts: thoſe which ſend, are either within or without the braine. Thoſe within are commonly full of excrements, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their colde diſtemperature, and alſo of their marrowiſh ſubſtance; thoſe without alſo, as betwixt the ſcull and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane next couering it, and betwixt this inner membrane, and the vttermoſt skin may be retained and gathered in great quantitie of water, either by the vapours, which not being able to paſſe any further, doe there growe thicke, or by the breathing forth of wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh humours out of the veines and arteries, which there ſtay and abide. From theſe parts then we ſhalf draw theſe differences of rheumes, there are outward ones which come from without, and runne downe by the continued proceeding of the membranes through all the outward parts, euen vnto the ioyntes, and make oftentimes the Goute: There are inward ones which come from within the braine, and runne diuerſe waies to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward partes. If they take the waie of the ſpinall marrowe, they will cauſe an Apoplexie, Palſey, aſtoniſhment, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: if they paſſe and fall into the eyes and eares, they will cauſe blindeneſſe and deafeneſſe: if they fall into the noſe, they will cauſe the diſeaſe, called Coryza: if into the palate and rough arterie, they will cauſe hoarceneſſe; as alſo ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of breath, the cough, the conſumption, if into the Lunges; and the fluxe of the bellie, called <hi>Lienteria,</hi> they fall into the ſtomacke.</p>

                  </gap>, the other are without daunger, and diſtill but ſoftly. There are rheumes without feauers; and there are ſome that are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

                  <note place="margin">The laſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>The laſt difference is taken from the maner of their generation and the efficient cauſes. There are ſome rheumes that are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as being begotten of the ſole defect of the braine, all the reſt of the body being found; and there are ſome which come by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as thoſe which are cauſed of the ill diſpoſition of the other parts: as of the liuer too much heated, and of the ſtomacke too much cooled; the liuer ouer hote doth ſend great quantitie of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours vnto the braine, and the ſtomacke too much cooled doth fill all full of crudities. There are epidemike or popular rheumes, and there are erraticke or hereditarie ones: the popular rheumes happen of the conſtitution of the ayre, as was the whupping or crowing diſeaſe which happened this yeare, and that which ranne through all Europe about tenne yeares agoe. The erraticke or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarie rheumes come of a particular conſtitution of the bodie, and of the maner of liuing, which is particular vnto euery one.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He cauſes of the rheume are either outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: the outward doe ordinarily ariſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the ayre, and of the manner of life. The ayre may alter and change vs three maner of waies; by his qualities, by his ſubſtance, and by his ſudden alteration and chaunge: that which is too cold, too hot, and too moyſt, is apt to beget rheumes: the hot ayre doth it by reſoluing and melting ſuch humours as are contained in the braine, for thus it maketh them the more apt to fall downe: the colde ayre is the cauſe of diſtillations, becauſe it preſſeth the braine together: and euen as a ſpunge full of water being preſſed, wee may behold the water to run out like a riuer on euery ſide: euen ſo the braine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhrunke together by colde, letteth all her humours glide and ſlip away: the ſame cold ayre may alſo bee the cauſe of rheumes, by repelling and cauſing to retire the naturall heate from the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:11348:84"/>parts, to the inner. The Southerne and Northerne windes are mightie cauſes to moue and make rheumes: for thoſe doe fill the braine and make it heauie, but theſe doe cauſe it to ſhrinke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Long tariance inthe Sun or open ayre doth effect as much. The ſudden change of the ayre, and alteration of ſeaſons are of the number of thoſe cauſes which inforce the rheume. As alſo if the ſeaſons doe keepe their naturall temper, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath very well obſerued in his third booke of Aphoriſmes, the yeare will greatly incline vnto rheumatikenes. If together with this partie alteration, or vtter ouerthrow of the temperature, there bee any particular defect in the ſubſtance of the ayre, as ſome ſecret and hidden corruption or infection, then it will ingender a popular and peſtilent rheume.</p>
               <p>The maner of liuing may likewiſe bee put in the ſcrole of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſes, which doe ingender and beget the rheume: much eating and drinking doe likewiſe fill the braine, and this is the cauſe why drunkards and gluttonous feeders, are ordinarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto the Wrangling rheume.. Great abſtinence may likewiſe cauſe rheumes in attenuating and making thin the humours; as alſo for that the ſtomacke being emptie, and not prouided of any thing to fill it ſelfe withall, is conſtrained to make attraction of ſuch moyſture as is in the parts neere about. Long watching, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſtudie, extreame violent paſſions of the minde, in as much as they ſpend and waſte the naturall heate and coole the brainer doe ingender rheumes: to liue all idle, doth keepe the excrements vnconſumed. Great euacuations, but eſpeciallie oft letting of blood, and in great quantitie, do caſt headlong the body into old age, and make it altogether rheumatike. Much ſleepe puffeth vp the bodie and maketh it moyſt, especially that which is taken at noonetide. And thus much for the outward cauſes which may. cauſe and mooue the rheume: let vs now come vnto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>The inward cauſes are either remote, or elſe conioyned: the remote (which it pleaſeth ſome better to call Antecedents) haue relation to the euill diſpoſition of the braine, head, liuer, ſtomacke, and ſometimes of the whole bodie.<note place="margin">The diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the braine cauſeth rheumes.</note> The cold, moyſt and hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature of the braine doe oftentimes cauſe rheumes, the cold
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:11348:85"/>and moyſt of their owne nature, the hot by way of accident: the cold diſtemperature weakeneth naturall heate, doth not make good diſgeſtion of nouriſhment, neither yet ſpend and waſte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary ſuperfluities: whereupon it followeth, that it muſt needs ſtore vp abundance of excrements. The hot diſtemperature at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth more nouriſhment then it can well diſgeſt, and moe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours then it can diſpatch and make away withall. There are ſome which haue very wittily obſerued, that the cloſenes of the ſubſtance of the braine, is oftentimes the cauſe of rheumes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it retaineth the vapours, and ſuffereth them not to ſpend by breathing out and euaporation.<note place="margin">The euil ſhape of the head.</note> The bad forme or ſhape of the head is likewiſe very forcible to procure rheumes: for ſuch as haue thc ſeames of their head very cloſe ſet together, or which haue not any at all, (as wee haue ſeene very many) are ſubiect to diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe the vapours retained doe turne into water, and in deede the ſeames were chiefly made to ſerue for a vent, and as it were a chimney vnto the braine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapture of the lower parts.</note> The diſtemperature of the lower parts, and eſpecially of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and ſtomacke, is one of the moſt ordinarie cauſes of the rheume, if wee beleeue <hi>Auicen</hi> the prince of the Arabians. For from the liner, being exceſſiuely hot, doe come as it were from a great burning cole many hot exhalations, which by the cold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the braine doe congeale and turne into water: I ſay further, that they which haue a very hot liuer, haue alſo their veines very hot, in ſuch ſort as that there riſe continually very hot vapours from them. The cold diſtemperature of the ſtomacke ingendring many crudities, my alſo be a cauſe of rheumes: for thereby al the bodie is cooled, the ſecond diſgeſtion not being able to correct the errour of the firſt, But if it ſhould ſo bee as that all the cauſes ſhould concur and iumpe together, that is to ſay, that the braine ſhould bee cold and moyſt, the lieu hot, the ſtomacke cold, there were no doubt, but that thereupon would follow a perpetuall generation of excrements in the braine: and this is that which the Arabians would haue ſayd, when they wrote that an vnequall diſtemperature of the principall parts is the greateſt occaſion of diſtillations. And thus much concerning the remote cauſes. The more neere or antecedent cauſes not onely of rheumes, but
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:11348:85"/>of all other fluxes of humours are three;<note place="margin">The cauſes more necrely procuring rheumes are three. The partſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> the part ſending, the part receiuing, and the nature of the humour. In the part ſending wee obſerue his high ſituation, and his ſtrength: if it bee indued with theſe two qualities, it will eaſily caſt his burthen vpon all the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour-parts, which are as it were vaſſals vnto it. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath well obſerued it in the booke of the wounds of the head, when he ſayth, that amongſt all the parts of the head, the brow is moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto inflammation, becauſe the brow is contained, but euery fluxe is from the part containing vnto the part contained: the brow is contained both in reſpect of the low ſituation thereof, as alſo in reſpect of the production of veſſels. The part receiueth the humour, either becauſe it is inferiour, or becauſe it is weake;<note place="margin">The part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing.</note> or becauſe it draweth it vnto it. Euery inferiour part is ſubiect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the burthen, of that which commanded it: but and if the part be weake, it will yet be the more apt. This weakenes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth either of it ſelfe, and from the proper nature of the part, or elſe by ſome accident:<note place="margin">The weake part.</note> the rare and ſpungie parts are naturallie weake, ſuch as are all the glandules, and it ſeemeth that nature of ſet purpoſe hath made them ſuch, to the end that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the excrements and ſuperfluities of the principall parts. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath debated this matter ſo well in his booke of Glandules, as that a man cannot tel how to adde any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. The skin was by nature made weak, to the end it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine al the ſuperfluities that are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within, whereupon ſome call it the vniuerſall emunctorie. Parts may alſo be weak by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, as by a fall, or blow, or ſome diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature: in what maner ſoeuer they bee weake, it maketh them apt to receiue the refuſe of their neighbour parts.<note place="margin">How the part attracteth the humour to it ſelfe.</note> The laſt cauſe is the part his attraction of the humour. The Arabians haue acknowledged three cauſes of this attraction; heate, paine, and the auoyding of vacuitie. Heate attracteth of it owne nature, becauſe it rarifieth the parts neere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, attenuateth and maketh thin the humours, and enlargeth the waies and paſſages, for the humour to runne through.<note place="margin">How paine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth.</note> Paine doth not attract of his owne nature, becauſe it is an affect of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: but feeling is a patient and no agent, and euery one of the ſences is executed by taking in of ſome thing: but the humours flow to the pained part, by reaſon of the weakenes of the ſame;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:11348:86"/>as alſo becauſe the naturall heat thereof is weakened by the paine and cannot well concoct the humour, it muſt needes bee that it ſhould ſtay in that place. They who affirme that the humour floweth vnto the part which feeleth the paine, becauſe nature ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thither both ſpirits and blood, that ſhe may comfort the ſame, doe deceiue themſelues in my judgement, and offer great wrong vnto nature: for if ſhe knew that ſuch a part ſtood in need of ſpirits and blood, ſhe would know therewithal, that in ſending this blood, ſhe ſhould profit the part nothing at all, but rather hurt it: ſo that paine doth not properly attract and draw. The laſt cauſe of diſtillations is imputed to the humour. For if it bee thin in ſubſtance, hot in temperature, ſharpe and pricking in qualitie, it will be a great deale the more apt to flow.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> A generall order of diet to be obſerued, for the preuenting and curing of Rheumes and diſtillations.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will follow the ſame order and courſe in the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe of this regiment, which I haue taken in the other two going before. Wee muſt therefore ſo diſpoſe of all the ſixe things which are called not naturall, as that they may not only hinder the engendring of rheumes, but alſo conſume and cure the ſame being alreadie begotten. Let euery man therefore make choiſe for himſelfe of ſuch an ayre as is temperate in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue qualities, and as for the paſſiue that it bee altogether drie: I ſay that it muſt be temperate in heate and cold, becauſe that a hot ayre reſoluing the humours of the braine, and a cold preſſing them out, cauſeth them to fall downe aboundantly. If the ayre bee too cold, it may bee corrected with good fires made of Iuniper, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie, Bay-tree, Oke, and Fig-tree: if it be exceeding hote, it may be cooled with hearbs and flowers that are indued with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie. There muſt care be had to auoide the Northerne and Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne windes, becauſe the one filleth the head full, and the other preſſeth it out. You muſt not abide much in the Sunne-beames,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:11348:86"/>nor yet in the open ayre. The windes which pearce through chinkes and rifts, are extreamely dangerous for the rheume. The inequalitie of the ayre (as <hi>Celſus</hi> obſerueth very well) doth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily further the begetting of rheumes: it is called an vnequal aire, when it is now hot, now cold. As concerning the paſſiue qualities, the ayre-muſt in all maner of diſtillation incline vnto drines: and for that cauſe it is good to dwell vpon mounted places, and ſuch as are farre from riuers.</p>
               <p>In meates three things are to be obſerued; the quantitie, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and manner of vſing them. As concerning the quantitie,<note place="margin">In meats three, things are to be obſerued.</note> all repletion and full gorging is enemie to ſuch complexions as are ſubiect vnto rheumes: we may not at any time eate to the full, it is better to riſe from the table hungrie, and hee cannot but fare the better, which cutteth of one meale in a weeke. As concerning the qualitie, it muſt bee contrary vnto the diſeaſe, or the cauſe thereof: the cauſe of rheumes is a ſuperfluous humour, ſo that it will bee fitteſt to vſe ſuch meates as may dry vp the ſame. All vaporous meates in generall muſt bee abſtained, as alſo meates that are groſſe, windie, full of excrements, and hard to diſgeſt. In the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vſing of theſe meates, there muſt many rules bee obſerued: as, there muſt no new meate bee taken into the ſtomacke, before the former bee throughly diſgeſted. You muſt content your ſelfe to feede vpon one onely diſh, and that ſuch as is good: for varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie filleth all full of cruditie, and it mingleth it ſelfe with the blood in the veines, and miniſtreth rheumatike matter vnto the braine. You muſt vſe to eate more at dinner then at ſupper, in as much as ſleepe which ſucceedeth ſupper within a ſhort time, doth ſend great ſtore of vapours vnto the braine, which are afterwards tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into water.</p>
               <p>The bread muſt bee of good wheate, and throughly baked,<note place="margin">Bread.</note> not cleane purged from his branne, but retaining a little branne and mixt with ſome ſalt; it muſt neuer be eaten hot: at the latter end of meate you may eate bisket, wherein ſome Aniſe and Fennell ſeede haue been put.</p>
               <p>Roſted meates are much better then boyled,<note place="margin">Fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and of them ſuch as doe not abound with humours: we allow the vſe of Capon, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,

The vſe of water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowles, Porke, Lambe, Mutton, and young Veale is forbidden: broths and pottage are very ill.</p>

               <p>All fruites that abound in moyſture,<note place="margin">Fruites.</note> as Apples, Plums, Melons, Cucumbers, and Mulberies are forbidden. But as for ſuch as haue propertie to drie, as Pine apples, ſmall nuts, Piſtaces, Almonds, Peares, Quinces, Figs, drie Raiſines, Medlers, Ceruiſſes, they may be vſed after meate. And thus much concerning meate.</p>
               <p>As concerning drinke,<note place="margin">Drinke,</note> cold water, and all maner of licour that is actually cold, it is enemie to al ſuch as are ſubiect to the rheume, if ſo bee that ſuch rheume be not extreame hot pricking, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an ague; Barley water with a little Sugar and Cinamome is very good and fit, or a Ptiſane, or water and Honey boyled together.</p>
               <p>If the ſtomack cannot indure the vſe of theſe waters,<note place="margin">Wine.</note> you muſt make choiſe of ſome well conditioned Wine, which is ſmall and neither ſweete nor biting. Muſcadels, Hypocras, and ſuch like mightie and ſtrong Wines, doe altogether ſtrike vp into the head, and fill the braine with vapours. To drinke aſſoone as a man is ſet downe at the table, doth cauſe and increaſe the rheume mightily: and there is nothing ſo daungerous to them which are troubled with the rheume, as to drinke when they goe to bed.</p>
               <p>Exceſſe of ſleepe maketh the bodie heauie, and heapeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtore of excrements:<note place="margin">Sleepe.</note> it ſhall bee ſufficient to ſleepe ſixe or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen houres, and in the meane time the head and the feete muſt be kept couered: for as <hi>Aristotle</hi> obſerueth, cold taken in the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:11348:87"/>parts doth infinitly indamage them which haue a cold and moyſt braine. In ſleeping it is good to lye with the head ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what high, and vpon the ſides: for to ſleepe vpon the backe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the bodie of the great hollow veine, which lieth vpon the backbone, and ſendeth great quantity of vapours vnto the braine. Let euery man watch well ouer himſelfe, that he vſe no ſleepe at noone, neither yet by and by after meate; it will be more health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to beſtow the time in ſome ſhort or gentle walke, or in ſome pleaſant and religious talke. You muſt not ſtraightwaies after meate applie your ſelfe to reading or writing, or any deepe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe ſuch action might turne the courſe of naturall heat out of the way, which ought altogether to be imployed in making diſgeſtion.</p>
               <p>Long watching may hurt as much as ouer much ſleepe, for that it ſpendeth naturall heate, and cooleth the braine.<note place="margin">Watching.</note> It is good to riſe early, and walking vp and downe the chamber, to cough, ſpet, and free ones ſelfe of all naturall excrements.</p>
               <p>The exerciſes of the whole bodie are much commended of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> that famous Phiſition,<note place="margin">Exerciſe.</note> and thoſe which are of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts, as frictions will ſerue for good vſe:<note place="margin">Frictions.</note> but if the head bee weake and very replete, it will require that ſuch friction be begun in the lower parts, and from thence to come vnto the thighes, backe, armes and necke, and to rubbe the hinder part of the head with bags or ſpunges artificially contained and made. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head is the fountaine of all diſtillations, it will be meete and conuenient to haue a ſpeciall regard and conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: it muſt not be ouerladen, neither yet too ſleightly couered, but after a meane and middle maner, and yet it is alwaies better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure too much heat then too much cold vpon it: it is not good to tye it too hard, leaſt it might draw humours from below.

               <p>We muſt now aduiſe what is to be done vnto the member re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing. Euery inferiour and infirme member is apt to receiue, but yet the care to be had of it is greater or leſſer, according as the patt is more or leſſe excellent and ſeruing our neceſſitie: if the rheume fall vpon the eyes, I haue alreadie ſet downe the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: if vpon the noſe, it muſt be turned ſome other way: if vpon the teeth, you ſhall ſee in the chapter following how they are to be preſerued: if vpon the ſtomacke, it may be caſt out by the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. The moſt dangerous of all is that which taketh his courſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rough arterie, and falleth ſuddenly into the breaſt or lungs, for it hindreth reſpiration, which is a moſt neceſſarie action, and ſo ſtiſleth the pattie. Such muſt be cared for and helped with all ſpeed, and that by vſing all thoſe remedies which I haue ſet down, to euacuate, diuert, and turne away this motion of humours: but if it ſhould fall out to be too ſwift,<note place="margin">When wee muſt ſtop the rheume.</note> we ſhall be conſtrained to cut it ſhort with remedies that ſhall be held in the mouth, and which one may ſwallow downe, beginning with the ſleighteſt, as Bole Armoniake, Terra Sigillata, Gumme Tragacanth, conſerue of old Roſes and roſed Sugar, of which there may bee made pretie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much as rheumes doe oftentimes fall downe vpon the teeth, and ſpoyle them very mightily, I am perſwaded that I ſhall not diſpleaſe the Ladies and Gentlewomen, if I deliuer in a ſmall chapter the meanes to preſerue the ſame.<note place="margin">Wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſeth the fairenes of the teeth. What may happen to the teeth.</note> To haue faire and ſound teeth, it behoueth that they ſhould be white, ſmooth, hard, ſtanding faſt, and that the fleſh of the gummes be whole, hard, and well truſſed vp. I purpoſe firſt to ſhew and make knowne that which may looſen, blacke, or canker them: and after I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the remedies which are moſt exquiſite, and may beſt ſerue for the making of them faire.<note place="margin">The ayre.</note> The cold ayre, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth in the fift booke of his Aphoriſmes, is enemie to the teeth. All raw,<note place="margin">Meates.</note> ſlimie, ſweete, ſharpe, fat, hard, vaporous meates, and ſuch as are actually cold, doe hurt the teeth infinitly. The raw meates doe ſend vp very many vapours which canker them, and make them blacke: ſweete, ſlimie, and fat meate doe leaue much filth about them: ſharpe meates ſet them on edge, and cauſe a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in them, by reaſon of their roughnes and vneuenes: hard meates doe ſhake them very much. It behoueth to vſe fleſh of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:11348:91"/>good iuyce, and which is diſgeſted eaſily: for who ſo will keepe their teeth faire, muſt aboue all other things take care of their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. The common vſe of milke, cheeſe, paſte meates, tarts and pulſe doe deſtroy the teeth: Sugar amongſt other things doth make them blacke. It is not good to chaw the meate vpon one ſide onely, but rather on both ſides equally, becauſe the teeth that are not vſed will corrupt. All fleſh of Lambe and Swine, and all fried meates, are extreamely contrary vnto them, as alſo the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vſe of fruits which are very moyſt. All writers haue marked that Leekes doe wholy ſpoyle both teeth and gummes.</p>
               <p>Wine muſt be well delayed before it bee drunke,<note place="margin">Wine.</note> and it muſt not bee ſweete, nor very cold. Very hote broths, as alſo all other meate exceeding hot doe ſpoyle them. There is care to bee had in keeping of them very cleane after eating: and therefore the tooth-pickes of Maſticke tree, Mulberie tree, Roſemary, Cipers, and other woods which haue ſome binding facultie are very fit: there may be added vnto the former a little of the wood of Aloes: They muſt not bee made cleane with a knife, pinne, or with any thing of gold or ſiluer, as many doe, becauſe that it doth looſen the ligaments. It muſt alſo be auoyded to lie digging at them any long time, eſpecially of ſuch as are ſubiect to diſtillations. After that the teeth are thus picked and cleanſed, they may bee waſhed with wine delayed. The continuall and common vſe of Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,<note place="margin">Sublimate hurteth them.</note> doth blacke and ſpoyle the teeth very mightily: but and if you would preuent that it ſhould doe no harme,<note place="margin">To vſe ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſo as that it may not hurt the teeth.</note> it muſt firſt bee well prepared, and afterward neuer to vſe it, but when it hath been ſteept in water three or foure moneths, chaunging the water the firſt moneth euery day, and once or twice a weeke in the reſt: it muſt alſo neuer bee vſed about the face, but the mouth muſt firſt be waſhed and the teeth cleanſed, and water kept in the mouth. And thus much for the things which may hurt the teeth.</p>
               <p>Let vs now ſee what things are good and profitable for them. There are ſome that haue their teeth very white, but they are not faſt, becauſe that either the ligaments are looſened, or for that the gummes haue loſt part of their fleſhie ſubſtance: other ſome haue their teeth faſt, but they be blacke. Wherefore there are two ſorts of remedies to bee prouided: the one to blanch and make white
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:11348:92"/>the teeth: the other to faſten them and incarnate. There are an infinite number of thoſe which doe make white the teeth, but I will chuſe the moſt fit and conuenient. The Greeke Phiſitions commend the pummice ſtone burnt and made in powder,<note place="margin">Things to make the teeth white.</note> more then any other thing, and their ordinarie remedie is this. Take of pummice ſtone and burned ſalt, of each three drammes; of <hi>Iuncus Odoratus</hi> two drams, of Pepper a dram and a halfe: make them all in powder, and therewith rub the teeth. We ſhall make a powder which in my opinion will be very fit. Take of pure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall a dram and a halfe,<note place="margin">A powder.</note> of white and red Corall of each one dram, of pummice ſtone and cuttle bone, of each two ſcruples, of very white Marble, of the toote of Florentine Ireos, of Cinamome and Dyers graine, of each halfe a dram, of common ſalt one dram, of Pearle well prepared a ſcruple, of Alablaſter and Roch Alome of each halfe a dram, of good Muske tenne graines: make them all into very fine powder, and rub the teeth therwith euery morning, waſning them afterward with white wine. With the very ſame powder there may be made Opiates, putting thereunto ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. The ſpirit of Vitrioll mixt with a little common water, doth white the teeth marueilouſly, and is one of the rareſt and moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular medicines that is. There are ſome which do much eſteeme <hi>Aquafortis</hi> well delayed with common water. There may alſo a water be diſtilled, which wil make them white. Take of liue Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Alome,<note place="margin">A diſtilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> Sal Gemma, of each a pound; of Vineger foure oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: others vſe the ſpirit of Vitrioll in ſtead of Vineger; diſtil here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a water with a retort, vſing a gentle fire, that ſo it may not ſmel of the Brimſtone. This water doth make the teeth very white, and cleanſeth rotten gummes. If the teeth be very blacke and filthie: Take of Barlie meale and common Salt two ounces,<note place="margin">A powder.</note> mixe them with Honey and make a paſte, which ſhall be wrapped in paper and dried in an ouen: you ſhal take of this powder three drams, of Crab-ſhels burned, pummice ſtone, egge ſhels in powder, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome, of each two drams; of the rinde of drie Citrons one dram: they ſhall all bee mixed together, and the teeth rubd therewithall. The rootes of Holihocks well prepared,<note place="margin">The prepared rootes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihocks.</note> doe mightily cleanſe and whiten the teeth. The way to prepare them is in this ſort: Take the rootes of Holihocke being made cleane, and cut them in many
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:11348:92"/>long peeces, boyle them in water with Salt, Alome, and a little of Florentine Ireos: afterwards drie them well in an ouen, or in the Sunne, and rubbe the teeth therewith. If the teeth be not faſt but ſhake to and fro: Take of the rootes of Biſtort and Cinquefoyle,<note place="margin">To faſten the teeth that ſhake and are looſe.</note> of each one ounce, of the rootes of Cypers two drams, of red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the rootes of white Thiſtle, and of the leaues or bark of Maſtick tree, of each halfe an ounce, of Sumach two drams, and of Cloues a dram: boyle al theſe in Smithes water and red wine, waſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with your gummes, putting thereto a little Alome. Or elſe: Take red Corall, Harts horne and Alome, of each a dram and a halfe, of Sumach, and of the rootes of white Thiſtle of each a dram: make them in powder, which you ſhall mixe with the iuyce or wine of Quinces, and apply them vpon the gummes and to the rootes of the teeth in the forme of an oyntment.<note place="margin">To beget fleſh about the teeth.</note> If the teeth be bare and without fleſh, they muſt bee couered by cauſing fleſh to grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with ſuch remedies as followe. There ſhall be made a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with Alome, red Corall, gumme and rinde of the Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe tree, with a little Ireos and Ariſtolochie. Or elſe take plume Alome, Pomegranat flowers and Sumach, of each two drammes, of Aloes wood, of Cyperus, of Mirrhe and Maſticke, of each a dram: make thereof a powder.<note place="margin">An Opiate.</note> Opiates alſo are very fit to beget fleſh, and doe abide better vpon the place. Take of Roch Alome halfe an ounce, of Dragons blood three drammes, of Mirrhe two drams and a halfe, of Cinamome and Maſticke of each a dram: make them all into very fine powder, and with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Honey make an Opiate, which you ſhall apply at euening vpon your gummes, and there let it remaine all night: the next day morning you ſhal waſh them with ſome aſtringent decoction or red wine. There bee ſome that take a corne of Salt euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their mouth; and letting it melt, doe rubbe the teeth with their very tongue, holding that this doth white and make faſt the teeth, hindring and keeping corruption and putrefaction from the teeth. And thus much for the preſeruation of the teeth.</p>

But thou wilt ſay, that it is continually repaired and renewed, and that the heate and moiſture influent, which come from the heart, as from a liuely fountaine, and are conueyed along by the arteries, as through certaine pipes, may reſtore and put as much againe in place,<note place="margin">Our naturall moiſture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his firſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer qualities.</note> as hath been loſt and ſpent.

As for the purenes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is eaſie to ſee, that the moiſture which commeth in place of that which was loſt, cannot attaine the ſame degree of perfection with the former; for our ſolide parts wherein conſiſteth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of life, are made of ſeede that is moſt pure, throughly wrought and concocted, and refined in all thoſe turning and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding labyrinths, which are to be ſeene in the veſſels of ſeede, and now they are nouriſhed onely with blood turned white by vertue of the ſaid ſolide parts, and that which paſſeth not through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny refining pipes, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that as wine the more that water is mixt with it, becommeth ſo much the more wateriſh, and in fine changeth altogether into water: euen ſo the radicall heate and moiſture waxe weaker and weaker euery houre, by the coupling of them with new nouriſhment, which is alwaies infected with ſome aduerſarie and vnlike qualitie. And ſeeing it is a generall vnchangeable and infallible rule in Philoſophie, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:11348:94"/>euery natural agent doth become a patient, and ſufferer in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his action, and ſo by conſequent doth weaken it ſelfe: our naturall heate weakening it ſelfe euery daye, cannot repayre that which is loſt, and place in other of the ſame degree of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it muſt of neceſſitie therefore grow olde, and in time dye right out.<note place="margin">The like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall moiſture cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</note> And as forthe quantitie of that which (as things that runne out) is waſted, it cannot be repayred altogether in the ſame proportion and meaſure, for the waſt is inceſſant, but the repayre is by little and little, and that after an infinite number of alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. See here how that which ſhould preſerue vs, doth ouerturne and deſtroy vs, and how our heate conſuming our radicall moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, doth thereby in the ende cut it owne throate. Theſe two cauſes doe ſpring, growe and are nouriſhed together with our ſelues. There is not that Phiſition in the world, were it <hi>Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> himſelfe, which can ſaue and deliuer vs. All the precious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours that are, <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> conſerues of Rubies and Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, <hi>Elixir vitae,</hi> or the fained and fabulous fountaine of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red youth cannot withſtand, but that our heate muſt at length grow weake and feeble.</p>

                  <hi>Galen</hi> derideth very well an Egyptian Sophiſter which had drawen commentaries of the immortalitie of the bodie. If a man (ſayth he) could when a thing is come to his perfection, renew the ſame, at that very inſtant, and make the principles thereof in like maner new, without doubt ſuch a bodie would become immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: but this thing being impoſſible, it muſt needes fall out that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery naturall agent muſt weaken it ſelfe, and ſo of neceſſitie waxe old. The men of Egypt &amp; Alexandria did beleeue that the natunall cauſe of olde age did come of the diminiſhing of the heart: they ſaid that the heart did growe till-fiftie yeeres the weight of two drams euery yeere, and that after fiftie yeeres it waxed leſſer and leſſer, till in the end it was growne to nothing: but theſe are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vaine imaginations and meere fooleries. We haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many old men to be opened, whoſe hearts haue been found as great and heauie as thoſe of the yonger ſort. There is then but two inward cauſes of our old age, the contrariety of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whereof we are compoſed and framed: and the action or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of our naturall heat, which conſiſting in the conſuming
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:11348:95"/>of his radicall moiſture, doth by little and little fall a drying and cooling of our bodies.</p>

For ſeeing that our bodies are compounded of three ſubſtances which are ſubiect to waſte, the one wherof is ſubtile and of an airie nature, the ſecond liquide, and the third ſolide: it muſt needes be that we haue ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing for to repaire them: otherwiſe our life would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer laſt longer then the ſeuenth daie: for this is the terme which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath giuen to perfect bodies, and ſuch as haue much naturall heate. That which repayreth our nature, is called nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and it is three fold, the ayre, drinke, and meates: the aire vpholdeth and maintaineth the ſubſtance of ſpirits, the drinke, all that which is liquide, and the meate, that which is ſolide. This threefolde kinde of nouriſhment, how well ſoeuer it be cleanſed and purified, hath notwithſtanding euermore ſomething diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with our nature, and that ſo much, as that it cannot aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate and turne it into it owne nature, and therefore maketh an excrement of it, which being retained, altereth the bodie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an infinite number of diſeaſes. See and beholde how meates doe of neceſſitie alter out bodies. I leaue to ſpeake of all other outward cauſes, (as ouer violent exerciſes, an idle and ſitting life, long and continuall watching, the paſſions of the minde (which of themſelues can make vs olde, as feare and ſadoes) becauſe we may in ſome ſort auoide and ſhunne them. I leaue alſo to ſay any thing of chancing cauſes, or ſuch as may befall vs by hap hazard, as hurts: I am onely purpoſed to ſhew that it is of neceſſitie that euery liuing creature muſt waxe olde, that he ſoſtereth within himſelfe, the naturall cauſes of his death, and that he hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſes thereof hanging about him, which cannot bee auoyded.</p>

I purpoſe not here to diſcuſſe the queſtion of numbers: I haue handled it largely enough in my third book of critical daies: it is ſufficient for me to ſit downe and reſt my ſelfe with all the moſt famous writers, in ſaying that man following the naturall courſe of life, vndergoeth fiue notable alterations and changes in his temperature, and runnoth through fiue ages, which are,<note place="margin">Fiue ages.</note> Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Adoleſcencie, Youth, Manhood or the conſtant age, and Old age.

In the mankind the voice groweth greater, all their waies and courſes ſtretch and reach further and further, they caſt their firſt wool. In the female kind their paps grow hard &amp; great to the ſight of the eye, their blood ſtirreth it ſelfe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all their bodie, and cauſeth it to giue place and make way for it, till it haue found out the doore: this age holdeth on to twenty foure or tweny fiue yeeres, which is the appointed and prefixed

This is the opinion comming neereſt to the trueth, &amp; which we muſt take hold vpon: for their leannes, wrinckles, ſtifnes of ſinewes and skin, and ſtifnes of ioints doe ſufficiently ſhew their drie temperature: the ringwormes alſo and itches ouer al their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the ſcales which they haue on their heads, maketh it plainely appeare vnto vs that their braine is full of ſalt humors, and not of ſweete flegme.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Allegorie.</note>In decrepite old age the Sunne and ſtarres do waxe darke, that is the eyes, which doe loſe their light. The clowdes returne after raine, that is to ſay, after they haue wept a long time, there paſſeth before their eyes, as it were clowdes, being nothing elſe but groſſe vapours, which grow thicke and foggie. The keepers of the houſe tremble, that is, the armes and hands, which were giuen vnto man for the defence of the whole bodie. The ſtrong men bow, that is to ſay, the legges which are the pillars whereupon the whole buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is ſet. The grinders doe ceaſe, that is to ſay, the teeth which ſerue vs to bite and chaw our meate. The ſeers grow darke by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the windowes: thoſe are the eyes which are couered and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrowne oftentimes with a cataract, which ſhutteth vp the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the eye, which is commonly called the window of the eye. The doores are ſhut without, becauſe of the baſe ſound of the grinding, that is the iawes, which cannot open for to eate any thing, or the paſſages of meate which are become narrow and ſtreite. They riſe vp at the voyce of the bird, that is to ſay, they can not ſleepe, and are alwaies wakened with the cockcrow. All the ſinging maides are abaſed, that is their voyce, which faileth them. The Almond-tree doth floriſh, that is the head, which becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all white. The graſhoppers waxe fat, that is, the legges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſwolne and puffed vp. The Caper-tree withereth, that is, their appetite is loſt: for Capers haue a propertie to ſtirre vp appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. The ſiluer chaine groweth longer, that is the faire and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull marrow of the back, going all along the bone, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth looſe and boweth, and cauſeth them to bend in the back. The golden ewer is broke, that is the hart, which containeth (much after the maner of a veſſell) the arteriall blood, and vitall ſpirit, which are ſomewhat yellow and of golden colour, which ceaſeth to moue, and cannot any longer containe or hold, much after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a thing that is broken. The water pot is broken at the ſpring head, that is, the great veine called the hollow veine, which cannot draw blood any more out of the liuer, which is the common ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe and fountaine which watereth all the bodie; in ſuch ſort as that it yeeldeth no more ſeruice then a broken pitcher. The wheele
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:11348:97"/>is broken at the ceſterne, that is, the reines and bladder, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come relaxed and cannot any longer containe the vrine. Then, when all this happeneth, duſt (that is to ſay, the body which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall) doth returne to the earth, and the ſpirit (which is come from aboue) doth returne to God. Loe here the fiue ages deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and bounded with their number of yeares, according to their ſeuerall contents.</p>

There are very many which become old men at fortie, and againe there are an infinit ſort, which are young men at ſixtie: there are ſome conſtitutions that grow old very ſpeedily, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers very ſlowly.

Weakenes maketh them to grow vp ſooner, and to waxe old ſooner: for euen as trees which are ſhort liued, grow vp to their height by and by; euen ſo the bodies, which muſt not long continue, come very ſpeedily to the top of their perfection. Their manner of liuing alſo doth make them to waxe old, becauſe they liue as it were alwaies in idlenes. But there is nothing that haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth old age more then idlenes.</p>

By his ſubſtance, as when it is well purified, not hauing any ſeeds of corruption in it, neither yet being infected with any venemous vapours, which might riſe from dead bodies, priuies, and filthines of townes, or from the putrifaction of ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding waters. There are alſo certaine plants which a man muſt hardly come neere vnto to make his ordinarie lodging, becauſe they haue a contrary qualitie vnto the animall ſpirit, as the Nut tree, Figge tree, Colewort, Danewort, wilde Rocket, Hemlocke, and an infinite ſort of others. The vapour of forges and mines, is a very great enemie vnto the hart, and cauſeth (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth) the greateſt part of them which labour therein, to fall into a conſumption.</p>

The vapour of Vineger doth marueilouſly correct y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maliciouſnes of the ayre.

I will not here particularly deſcribe all the meates which may hurt or profit; or which are of a good or euill iuyce, let thoſe which are diſpoſed reade what is written by <hi>Galen</hi> in his bookes of the properties of nouriſhments, and in his bookes of the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of health. I will onely in this chapter deliuer the generall rules, which I haue drawne out of other Phiſitions, and aboue all out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which ſhall ſerue all ſortes of ages to keepe them from growing old ſoone, and the firſt of them is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt rule.</note>A man muſt neuer eate but when he hath ſome feeling of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: for the ſtomack maketh ſmall reckoning of ſuch meates as it coueteth not, and oftentimes diſgeſteth better the worſt ſorts of meates when it receiueth them with an appetite, then the moſt delicate which doe not delight and pleaſe it. This rule is to bee found in the 38. Aphoriſme of his ſecond booke.<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> The ſecond rule is, that the meate be well chawed before it be ſwallowed: for there follow two diſcommodities when it is ſwallowed before it bee well chawed; the firſt is, that one ſhall eate more then he ſhould,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:11348:100"/>and thereby ouercharge his ſtomacke; the other is the greata doe that the ſtomacke hath to concoct that which is not chewed. The teeth and mouth doe as much ſeruice and helpe in making prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the firſt diſgeſtion, as the ayre doth for the cookes, when it maketh their meate tender: and this is the reaſon why they which haue many teeth doe liue long, namely, becauſe they chaw their meate well. This ſentence is to be found in the ſixt ſection of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. booke of Epidemicall diſeaſes.<note place="margin">The third.</note> The third rule is, that wee muſt beware of glutting the ſtomack: for he that would liue long; muſt riſe vp from the table alwaies with ſome hunger. The reaſon is very apparant, becauſe if you loade your ſtomack too much, you put the naturall heat (being the principall inſtrument of the ſoule) to too much paines, and cauſe it to languiſh in the end, becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery natural agent, doth ſuffer in doing. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath very wel noted the ſame in his 6. book of his Epidemicall diſeaſes. This (ſaith he) is one of the principall heads for to preſerue health, not to feed vnto the full, and not to beſtow to labour.<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> The fourth rule is, not to eate of moe then one or two ſorts of meats: for varietie hurteth infinitly and ouerthroweth our ſtomacks, becauſe meates are not all of one qualitie, and by conſequent one degree of heat will not ſuffiſe: ſome ſortes are concocted ſooner, and other ſome more ſlowly, ſo that thereby all the kitchin is out of order. You may ioyne here to, that eating varietie of meates and ſawces, a man is conſtrained to drink the oftner: but this maner of drinking doth hinder diſgeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as you ſee that the putting of water ſundry times into the pot, doth hinder the broth from boyling. Therefore you muſt neuer abuſe the ſtomack, although it be very good, becauſe that if you diſpleaſe the cook, you are like to dine but badly. Reade the worthie ſentence of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the 3. ſection of his 6. book of Epidemicall diſeaſes. The ſlothfulnes of the ſlomack (ſaith he) commeth of the diſordering of the whole bodie, and of the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the veſſels. And as fulnes doth greatly damnifie, and fill al full of crudities; euen ſo too much abſtinence may heap a whole meaſure of diſcommodities vnto the health, becauſe the ſtomacke being emptie, doth fill it ſelfe with euill humours. And <hi>Galen</hi> alſo obſerueth, that a famiſhed ſtomacke, if it bee not ſatisfied with ſome delectable licour, draweth firſt from the braine a world of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:11348:100"/>water, and after that the groſſeſt excrements, that are in the gut <hi>Ileum.</hi> The fift rule teacheth to obſerue ſuch an order in eating,<note place="margin">The fifth.</note> as that thoſe meates which are eaſily corrupted be firſt eaten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that if they be taken in the end, they deſtroy and corrupt the others: ſuch as are concocted with leſſe paines, and ſooner diſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, ought firſt to enter into the ſtomack: but groſſe meats, hard and heauie meates ſhall be the laſt, quite contrary to the faſhion of our artificiall kitchins. Such meates as are apt to looſe the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as plums, apples and potage, muſt alſo be the firſt.<note place="margin">The ſixt.</note> The laſt rule is, that wee muſt accuſtome ourſelues to eate more at ſupper then at dinner, I meane if the bodie be ſound and not ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rheume. The reaſons thereof are very plaine: for there is more ſpace from ſupper to dinner, then there is from dinner to ſupper, ſo that there is more time to concoct and diſtribute the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is moſt certaine that when we ſleepe, heat is ſtronger, for that it withdraweth it ſelfe wholly vnto the center of the bodie. I will adde thereto how that to make good diſgeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue need of reſt: but in the night al the animal functions ceaſe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to draw aſide our heat, ſo that it may concoct a great deale better. Thus alſo haue all the famous and great Phiſitions, <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Galen</hi> and <hi>Auicen,</hi> determined the caſe. Thus haue all the elder times practiſed. Wreſtlers (as <hi>Galen</hi> obſerueth in the fift booke of the conſeruation of health) did neuer eate fleſh but at their ſupper. The Pythagoreans (as <hi>Aristoxenus</hi> writeth) tooke nothing to dine withall but a little bread with honey: and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> the Grecian ſouldiers (if wee giue credit to that which <hi>Philemon</hi> reporteth) made foure meales a day, but they tooke nothing but bread and wine at the three firſt, and at the laſt which was their ſupper, they did feede vpon porke. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here the generall rules which are to bee obſerued in eating, whereto I will adde for an end, that the fitteſt houre to eate at, is that houre of the day which is moſt temperate, as in winter that which is moſt hot, in ſummer that which is moſt freſh, and that alſo with ſome moderate exerciſe hauing gone before.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He victuals wherewith old men are to be nouriſhed, muſt bee prouided according to the degrees of their old age. The firſt kind of old age which is yet greene and ſtrong, may take direction from all thoſe rules, which I haue ſet downe in the chapter going before: but the other two kindes of ages, haue neede to bee guided after this faſhion. They muſt bee heated and moyſtned, becauſe their temperature is cold and drie. Let them therefore haue euen all of them, their lodging in a very warme ayre, and let their chamber be neuer without fire.<note place="margin">The quantitie of their meate.</note> In ſeruing them with meate, there muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard be had of the quantitie, qualitie, and maner of vſing of it. As concerning the quantitie, wee muſt neuer ouerloade them with much meate, becauſe (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerueth in the fourtenth Aphoriſme of the firſt booke) they haue very little quantitie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate, and that would be quenched, as it falleth out when a great deale of wood is caſt vpon a little deale of fire, and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more (as the ſame author ſayth) becauſe they can indure faſting very eaſily.<note place="margin">The qualitie.</note> As concerning the qualitie, it is requiſite that their meates be of good iuyce and eaſie diſgeſtion, and of a light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in as much as the ſubſtance of old folke doth not lightly waſt and ſpend it ſelfe. They muſt be forbidden all ſlimie, groſſe, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, flegmaticke, melancholike and obſtructing meates, which may ſtop the paſſages. The maner that they muſt be made to vſe in taking them, is to nouriſh them a little &amp; oft, principally thoſe which are of a decrepite age: others which remaine ſomewhat Iuſtie, ſhall bee content with three meales a day. So were the two old men fed, of whom <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaketh in his fift booke of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of health, that is to ſay, <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Phiſition, and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephus</hi> the Grammarian. Their bread muſt bee of good wheate well baked, leauened well, and hauing a little ſalt mixt with it; they muſt not eate it hot, becauſe it is not ſo eaſily diſgeſted, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:11348:101"/>a great deale more alterations in the bodie, ingendreth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and ſendeth many vapours to the braine, it muſt bee of the ſame day or two daies old, if it paſſe three daies it drieth too much, and ſtaieth too long time in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtomack. Al maner of cakes made with cheeſe, milke, butter; &amp; all other ſorts of vnleauened bread, are very hurtfull vnto them.<note place="margin">Fleſh.</note> Fleſh is a very good nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for it nouriſheth much, and turneth eaſily into blood. All fleſh that is hard of diſgeſtion and clammie, is altogether contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto this age; the fleſh of birds is ſooner concocted, then that of foure footed beaſts; and ſuch as feede in drie places are more holeſome, then thoſe which feede in wateriſh places. Wee muſt make choiſe of ſuch fleſh as is of a middle age, for old folke: for young fleſh is too moyſt, and old fleſh is too drie. Their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be of good Capon, Chickens, Partridge, Feaſant, Hen, Mutton, Veale, God wit or Morehen, and yong Pigeons. The Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians highly commend Turtle doues, becauſe they turne into good iuyce, and make all the ſences the more ſubtile and fine. Some there bee which praiſe porke, becauſe it commeth next in temperature vnto man: but I forbid it vnto old men, becauſe it ingendreth much ſuperfluous moyſture. All the braines of beaſts are hurtful vnto the ſtomacke; liuers doe ingender a groſſe blood; the vtmoſt parts, as the head, the tayle and feete, are hard of diſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and of ſmall nouriſhment. The fleſh of Lambe, Beefe, Wild-bore, and birds of the riuer, are naught for the ſtomackes of old men; they muſt haue made ſome delicate gallimaufrie with ſome ſauce, good coolaſſes, gellie, and white meate.<note place="margin">Egges.</note> Egges new layd and ſoft are very good for them, for they nouriſh much and quickly; if they be hard or fried, they be naught, becauſe they ingender a groſſe iuyce, and ſtay too long in the ſtomacke. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched egges ate moſt holeſome; and thoſe which are boyled in hot water (which <hi>Aetius</hi> tearmeth to ſtifle) are much better then them which are roſted in hot aſhes, becauſe they are boyled in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place equally and alike. But in what manner ſoeuer they bee eaten, they muſt bee eaten alwaies with ſalt, to the end they may goe out of the ſtomacke the ſooner: the white of the egge doth nouriſh but a little, and troubleth the ſtomacke.<note place="margin">Fiſh.</note> The vſe of fiſh is contrarie to their age, they may eate of a Rochet, Sole and Trout,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11348:102"/>but they muſt be ſowſt with ſalt, ſage, fennell and wine. Meates of a ſharpe taſte and which bite a little, as alſo powdred meates, are not euill, becauſe they ſtirre vp the appetite, awake naturall heate, and conſume all that ſtore of groſſe flegme which is within the ſtomacke.<note place="margin">Spices.</note> It is good to ſpice their meates, with Pepper, Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Cinamome, and to vſe gray muſtard. Onions and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like are not euill for them, if they loue them, and haue been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to eate them. Cheeſe is naught: butter is wholeſome for them, becauſe it moyſtneth and heateth them, and alſo gratifieth the breaſt: ſweete oyle Oliue is alſo excellent good. Milke is good for ſome: but in ſuch as are ſubiect to many obſtructions, it rather doth harme. They of old time haue much eſteemed the vſe of Honey in this age, ſpreading it vpon their bread, putting it in their ſauces,<note place="margin">Fruites.</note> and almoſt in all their meates. Raw fruites, and ſuch as are very moyſt, are not good for them, becauſe they are eaſily corrupted. Damaske and dried Raiſines are good for the liuer, ſtomacke, reines and bladder. Almonds doe procure ſleepe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe (if we beleeue <hi>Auicen</hi>) the ſubſtance of the braine, and cleanſe the paſſages of vrine. Drie Figs, Piſtaces, Dates, ſmall nuts roſted, nuts confected with Honey, Mirobalanes, Oliues, and Pine-apples are very fit for old men.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Rinke is as neceſſarie and profitable for olde men, as it is hurtfull for children.

Wine is all their refreſhment,<note place="margin">The praiſe of wine.</note> and therefore ſome doe call it old folkes milke; it heateth all their parts, and caſteth out the wateriſh parts of the foure humours by vrine. <hi>Plato</hi> in his ſecond booke of Lawes writeth, that wine heateth the body, and reuiueth the drouping ſpirits of old men, euen as the yron relenteth with the heate of the fire. <hi>Zeno</hi> ſayd oftentimes, that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:11348:102"/>wine correcteth and maketh pleaſant the manners of the moſt harſh and churliſh natures. One of the moſt renowmed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that euer Arabia bred, writeth, that yong folke muſt refraine wine: but ſo ſoone as they bee fortie yeeres olde, looke how oft they either ſee or ſmell it, they ought to praiſe God, and giue him thankes for creating of ſo pleaſant and delightſome a licour. The wine that is chiefly to bee made choiſe of for old folke,<note place="margin">What wine is beſt for olde folke.</note> muſt be an old, red, and good ſtrong wine, and it muſt not bee much delayed. New, ſweete and groſſe, are not good, becauſe they ſtop the liuer, the ſpleene and paſſages of vrine, and make old age ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto the dropſie or ſtone. It is not good to drinke wine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, nor after that one is throughly heated, becauſe the vapour thereof aſcendeth by and by vp into the head, hutteth the ſinewes, and cauſeth conuulſions, ſudden rheumes and apoplexies. Olde men muſt drinke a little at once and oft. <hi>Galen</hi> commendeth artificiall wines, made of Betonie and Parcelie, for the Stone and Goute, Hippocras, Malmeſie and Candie wine; foreſeene that they be not counterfeited, neither yet contrarie to their natures. Honyed water is commended of all men, they may vſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for their ordinarie drinke, and the other (which is called the counterfeite of wine, being ſtrong like vnto Malmeſie) they may take in the morning with a toſte,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is moſt certaine, that all manner of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment how cleane and pureſoeuer it bee, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſomething in it not agreeable vnto nature. It muſt neceſſarily therefore follow, that in euery concoction there be ingendred ſome excrement, which being kept and not auoyded, may bee the cauſe of an infinite ſort of diſeaſes. The groſſer kinde of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe purge themſelues, by a ſenſible and manifeſt kinde of euacuation: but the more ſubtile and fine maybe waſted and reſolued by exerciſe.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:11348:103"/>
               <p> This is the cauſe why diuine <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his bookes of Diet,<note place="margin">The neceſſitie of exerciſe.</note> hath affirmed, and that very well, that man cannot liue in health, if he ioyne not labour and foode together, becauſe (ſayth he) that the one repayreth natures expences, and the other ſpendeth her ſuperfluities and ſurcharging burthens. <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Theaetetus</hi> writeth, that exerciſe vpholdeth and preſerueth the good ſtate of the bodie, and that idlenes on the contrarie doth ouerthrow it. Exerciſe moderatly and orderly vſed, preuenteth repletion, the meere nurſe of a thouſand diſeaſes, increaſeth naturall heate, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth open both the ſenſible and inſenſible paſſages of the bodie, maketh the bodie plyant and nimble, prepareth and diſpoſeth all the ſuperfluities and excrements, as well vniuerſall as particular, vnto auoidance, ſtrengtheneth the ſinewes marueilouſly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all the ioynts more firme. And this is it which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith in his Epidemicall treatiſes, that as ſleepe is requiſite for the inward parts, ſo labour ſerueth to ſtrengthen the ioynts. There is a notable treatiſe in <hi>Celſus,</hi> which I muſt not paſſe ouer with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Sluggiſh ſlothfulnes (ſayth he) doth make the bodie looſe and heauie, but paines and labour doth make it firme and nimble: idlenes maketh vs ſoone to waxe old, and exerciſe preſerueth our youthfulnes long and many yeares.<note place="margin">How we muſt vſe our exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</note> But we muſt carrie our ſelues cunningly in the manner of our exerciſes: firſt, it muſt bee done before we eate, becauſe thereby wee awake naturall heate, that it may be the readier to diſgeſt, and not aſleepe when it ſhould bee doing his dutie. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Aphoriſme is moſt plaine and euident: Let labour goe before meate. This exerciſe muſt be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated according to our meate: for they that eate much, muſt worke much; and they that eate but a little, muſt labour the leſſe. This exerciſe alſo muſt be moderate and equall. I call that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which maketh not wearie: and I call that equall, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth all the parts of the bodie both vpper and lower alike. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and vnequall exerciſe ouerthroweth the ſtrongeſt bodies, weakeneth their ioynts, and maketh all the muſcles looſe, wherein conſiſteth a part of nimblenes. The morning exerciſe is beſt, or elſe at after dinner when the two firſt concoctions are perfected: that which is vſed by and by after meate, begetteth an infinite number of obſtructions, filleth the veines with raw humours, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:11348:103"/>cauſeth the meate to deſcend too ſoone out of the ſtomacke. In winter we muſt walke more ſwiftly, and in ſummer more ſoftly: and alwaies the Phiſition muſt haue regard to that whereunto the partie is accuſtomed: for as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writeth in his ſecond book of Aphoriſmes; They which are accuſtomed to take paines, doe beare it the more eaſily, although they be weake, and come to old age. There are vniuerſall and particular exerciſes. The vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall (if a man can do them) are the better: and amongſt them, one praiſeth eſpecially the ball play, foote-walkes, and riding. The particular are fricaſies, which auaile much to the ſtirring vp of naturall heate, to make attraction of nouriſhment to any part, and to conſume the vapours and excrements of the third concoction, which lie lurking oftentimes in the voide ſpaces of the muſcles and among the membranes.</p>
               <p>Old folke muſt content themſelues with moderate exerciſe,<note place="margin">The exerciſe of old folke.</note> for feare that the little naturall heat which they haue ſhould be ſpent.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Leepe is one of the chiefe poynts of well ordering and gouerning ones ſelf: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning which there are certaine generall rules to be obſerued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are deſirous to keep back and hinder the haſtie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of old age. It is good (ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) to ſleepe onely in the night, and to keepe waking in the daytime. Sleeping at nooneday is very dangerous, and maketh all the body
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:11348:104"/>heauie and blowne vp. It muſt be obſerued not to goe to bed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three or foure haures after ſupper, and then alſo to take a little walke vp and downe the chamber before you goe into bed. The beſt and moſt naturall ſleepe is that which laſteth ſeuen houres, and in that time not to haue ouer many clothes vpon the bed, to the end the vapours may haue the freer paſſage. One muſt ſleepe hauing their head ſomewhat raiſed, leaſt the meate ſhould riſe from the bottome of the ſtomacke vnto the vpper mouth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and in ſleeping he muſt not lie vpon his backe, leaſt the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie excrements of the braine, which are purged by the noſe and mouth, ſhould fall vpon the backe bone; and leaſt alſo that by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon his backe, he ſhould heate the groſſe hollow veine and great arterie, which are faſtned to the loynes, and ſo theſe veſſels thus heated, ſhould increaſe the heate of the reines, ingender the Stone, and ſend great quantitie of vapours vnto the braine. It is good to take his firſt ſleepe vpon the right ſide, for ſeare the liuer ſhould fall vpon the ſtomacke and oppreſſe it, as it would doe if he ſhould he vpon the ſpleene; and further becauſe that lying on the right ſide, he liuer vnderlaieth the ſtomacke, and ſeruing it in ſtead of a chafing-diſh, helpeth diſgeſtion very much. After this he muſt turne him vpon his left ſide, to the end that the vapours retayned by lying on the right ſide, may breathe out: &amp; finally he muſt lie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right ſide, to the end that what ſhalbe concocted, may diſcend the more eaſily. The parts of the bodie muſt not be ſtretched out al along in ſleeping, they muſt be ſomewhat drawne vp: for as <hi>Galen</hi> obſerueth in his firſt booke of the mouing of the muſcles, the reſt of the muſcles conſiſteth in a meane kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. And that is the figure, which the Anathomiſts call the meane or middle figure, which is moſt naturall and leaſt painfull. And thus much for the generall rules of ſleepe, which ſeeing all old men cannot tell how to keepe, we will permit them to ſleepe a little after dinner, in as much as they cannot but lie waken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all nights long. Some referre the cauſe of their lying awake to their temperature, which is drie, and to the ſharpe vapours which commonly are raiſed of ſalt flegme.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Lato</hi> in a Dialogue, which he intituleth <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides,</hi> writeth as the trueth is, that the moſt violent and dangerous diſeaſes that the body ſuffereth, doe come from the minde: for the minde (ſayth he) hauing a ſoueraigne power and abſolute authoritie to command the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,<note place="margin">The power of the minde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the bodie.</note> moueth, altereth, and chaungeth it in a moment as it pleaſeth. How many diſeaſes doe we ſee to riſe, and to bee cured by the onely force of imagination? How many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples haue we of ſuch as ſudden and extreame ioy hath brought vnto their end? And griefes, penſiuenes, and ſadnes, doe they not caſt vs headlong into an infinite number of melancholike diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſerue for a ſcourge vnto the Phiſition, and their owne confuſion for their obſtinacie? Wee haue read many hiſtories of ſuch as haue growne white haired in foure and twentie houres, vpon feare onely and a conceited opinion of death. So that hee which would liue long and in health, muſt keepe himſelfe as much as he can free from all violent paſſions. But olde men more then any other muſt beware, both becauſe they are ordinarily more ſubiect to feare, taking of offence, and waywardnes, becauſe of their cold diſtemperature: as alſo becauſe of the weakenes of their braine. And other men muſt indeuour to take from them all occaſion of feare and ſadnes, leaſt they ſhould thereby become more cold. There is no danger now and then to moue their cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, thereby to rouſe them vp and warme them a little: they muſt bee made merrie as much as may bee, and euery thing miniſtred vnto them that may content and pleaſe them. But for as much as all the pleaſures and diſpleaſures which wee feele in our mindes, doe riſe from the ſences, which are the truſtie ſpyes, and faithfull meſſengers thereof, wee muſt (if wee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and pleaſe olde men,) flatter and tickle their ſences,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:11348:105"/>the ſight, hearing, ſmelling and taſte, in prouiding for euery one of them, matters that are moſt agreeable and fit for them. The eye delighteth it ſelfe wonderfully in the beholding of beautifull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;<note place="margin">The pleaſures of ſight.</note> and I am of opinion that ſuch ſight onely will content old men. Varietie of flowers, and diuerſitie of faire colours doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce them infinitly. They muſt weare continually ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rich and precious Iewell, and amongſt others the Saphir and Emerauld, becauſe there is not any other colour that doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and comfort the ſight ſo much as doth the greene and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. The hearing hath his particular delights, which pearce yet more deeply,<note place="margin">The rauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the eare.</note> and ſound the very bottome of the minde. Muſicke with voyces and inſtruments, doth calme and make gentle the moſt outragious, rough and ſterne natures. <hi>Clinias</hi> (as I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the treatiſe of melancholike diſeaſes) ſo ſoone as he ſaw any paſſion to aſſaile him, tooke his harpe, and by this meanes kept away the motions of his humour. Old men muſt be held vp with ſuch diſcourſes as they like of; they muſt bee praiſed, they muſt bee flattered, they muſt not bee gainſayd in anything, and there muſt bee propounded vnto them matter which may pleaſe them, and whereunto they haue been brought vp; as lucre and gaine vnto the marchant; great exploytes and feates of armes, to the warriour; learned diſcourſes, to ſuch as are learned: for theſe doe hold them awake and content. Witneſſe hereof is that good old man and graue law-maker <hi>Solon,</hi> who being in his death-bed, and ſeeing two or three of his friends whiſpering together, for feare they ſhould offend him, did liſt vp himſelfe luftely, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to ſpeake aloude, thinking himſelfe moſt happie if at his laſt houre he might leame any thing.<note place="margin">The pleaſures of ſmelling.</note> As concerning the ſence of ſmelling, it is moſt certaine that good ſmels doe make the heart ioyfull and merrie, and purifie the ſpirits. I am of opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it were good for olde men to carrie about them ſome good odours, as chaines and balles of Muske, that they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in their chamber ſome good parfumes, that they waſh their beards,<note place="margin">The pleaſures of the taſte.</note> hands and faces with ſweete waters. As for the taſte, it is to be referred vnto the victuals, and for it there muſt daily bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided ſome daintie diſh, and ſome one meate or other that is ſharpe in taſte, to ſtirre vp their appetite. Behold therefore and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:11348:105"/>ſee wherein conſiſteth the maner of dyet to be obſerued of olde folke: and it behoueth (that I may make an end of the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) that euery one become wiſe, to know his naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that experience of ſuch things as do him good or harme, make him a maiſter and Phiſition vnto himſelfe.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O many are the diſcommodities which olde age bringeth with it, as that the learned of olde time did thinke it to come neerer to the nature of a diſeaſe then of health.<note place="margin">The diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon old men.</note> You ſhall ſee olde men commonly to be coſtiue, to abound with fleagme, and ſharpe wateriſh humours, which cauſes ſome ſmall itchings and burning of vrine, they are all full of windines, and feele an vniuerſall weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ouer all their bodies, becauſe they haue a weake ſtomacke, and the naturall heate of their whole bodie is faint and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are in a maner altogether ſubiect to theumes, and ceaſe not either to cough, ſpit, or weepe. All theſe infirmities may be prouided againſt by ſome gentle and delightſome medicines. And firſt of all, the bellie muſt be made good,<note place="margin">How the belly may be kept ſoluble. A laxatiue broth.</note> (that is to ſay looſe) with artificiall brothes, which may bee prepared diuerſe waies. Take of the tender crops of Mallowes, of Mercurie, Garden and wilde Artichoke, and of the hearbe called Cynocrambe, boyle them with a Chicken, and take it in the morning. The broth of red Coleworts with oyle, is very good, but the broth of a Cocke is the excellenteſt of all the reſt: it muſt be made thus. Take an olde Cocke, pull him and beate him well, afterward kill him,<note place="margin">The broth of a Cocke.</note> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken out his guts, waſh him twiſe or thriſe in white wine, and ſtuffe his bellie with a handful of the rootes of Percely, the leaues of Borage, Bugloſſe, Burnet, Mercurie, Artichoke of the garden and field, fat Figs, damaske Raiſins, Dates, Iuiubes the ſeed of Carthamus and Hiſope, boile all theſe together perfectly, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:11348:106"/>afterward ſtraine them very well for the purpoſe, and cauſe it to be taken three dayes together. Some put thereto a little of the ſalt of Tartar, to giue it ſome ſharpenes. This broth ſerueth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well for olde men, for it keepeth the bodie looſe, cleanſeth the waies of Vrine, and is very profitable for the breaſt, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of breath, whereunto they be ſubiect. Suppoſitories muſt be ordinarilie vſed of them, as alſo mollifying Clyſters. <hi>Galen</hi> would not that we ſhould vſe any ſtrong and ſharpe Clyſters, he reſteth contented in the onely vſe of oyle Oliue. For inward Laxatiues I like well and allow of the pills of Hiera, of Aloes well prepared, and thoſe which are called Maſtichinae. Turpentine cleanſeth and purgeth all the inward parts,<note place="margin">Remedies for the weakenes of their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</note> without danger for the weakenes of their ſtomacke, and to diſcuſſe the windes which put them to paine, the roote of Ginger confected, Lozenges of <hi>Aromaticum Roſatum,</hi> ſugard Aniſe ſeede, Cinamome water, the eſſence of Aniſe ſeede,<note place="margin">To ſtirre vp the heate of olde folke.</note> of Iuniper berries and Cloues is commended. To ſtir vp the heate which may ſeeme to be aſleepe all ouer the bodie, I finde nothing better, then to cauſe them to take oftentimes the weight of two French Crownes of Amber Griſe in a very new egge. I allow alſo of the vſe of Treacle, Mithridate, Confectio Alkermes, Aquae Theriacales, Imperiales, and Caeleſtes. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions whereof I ſet not downe, becauſe they are at this day ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common. All the parts alſo may be ſtrengthned with outward medecines, as the braine by caps and head powders, amongſt which <hi>Auenzoar</hi> praiſeth Cloues powdred and ſcattered vpon the Coronall ſuture, the heart by emplaſters, oyntments, and bags, the ſtomacke by oyntments and bags. Finally, we muſt thinke, that all aromaticall things, and thoſe which ſmell well, are good for olde folke.</p>
